vulnerable communities of Luanda, Angola, by organizing a 3-day literature and culture festival. The Ananse project addressed critical issues such as the lack of education and basic literacy, the
decolonization of traditional Angolan and African knowledge transmission, and the failure to incorporate
creative and traditional methods into children's and youth education. The project empowered young
people from the provinces of Cunene, Benguela, Huila, and Huambo by providing them with intensive
training in oral storytelling, creative writing, cultural journalism, and audiovisual production. This initiative
culminated in a 3-day literature and culture festival. By doing so, it strengthened cultural preservation,
created new forms of educational inclusion, amplified marginalized discourse, expanded access to
knowledge, and improved dialogue between traditional Angolan communities.  The festival, which was freely accessible to young people and children, is part of the
second phase of this project, which took place over three days in 3 different spaces, among them: the
school complex on the outskirts of Luanda (Lar de Nazaré), a place with a high illiteracy rate, the BAI
Academy university and the peripheral arts center Horizonte Njinga Mbandi. The festival was attended by a total of 2000 people. In addition to the presentation of the projects of the young trainees, 12
discussion tables and 15 interactive cultural activities were held, always anchored in Angolan narratives
collected in trips and interviews with local communities.  ""The ANANSE Festival taught me that storytelling is also building peace. I have found that Angolan oral
literature can be a powerful tool to unite generations, create empathy and inspire social change."" The ANANSE Festival promoted an inclusive space that connected young people, educators and
communities around literature and storytelling. In the short term, it offered new tools to students and
cultural access to vulnerable communities. In the long run, it strengthens a network of educators and
young creators who can replicate the methodology."
2259,“Divine Footprints:” Using Musical Theatre to tell Sacred Stories,Grinnell College,Nicholas Lampietti,Jaipur,"26.919620,75.787810",Social Cohesion,,Art & Design,Dialogue,No,"This project leveraged theatre’s unique capacity as a peacebuilding tool by fusing the genre of
Broadway with folk and classical Indian performance traditions to tell the life story of Siddhartha Gautama,
the Buddha, in the form of an original musical. Convened through a series of workshops, artists and
scholars from across India collaborated to develop the piece while critically engaging questions of
religious violence and articulating possibilities for more harmonious coexistence in a South Asian context. Despite strong synergies between my skillset and the proposed project, bringing my vision to life
proved to be enormously challenging and rewarding. Early on, I encountered persistent obstacles in
building partnerships and managing logistics from the United States, even though I was collaborating
closely with a local partner. Given these difficulties, I chose to pivot from a single summer-long formal
workshop to multiple shorter, more flexible sessions that targeted specific elements of the theatrical
process. Narrowing the project’s thematic focus to Buddhism also proved beneficial, allowing me to better
align my existing knowledge with the content of the workshops while further deepening discussions on its
current social and political implications.  Just as the workshop model of theatre-making is shaped by conversations and
shared experiences of its participants, our understanding of peace emerges through ongoing reflection... peace is found in our willingness to
interrogate practices that sustain discrimination and oppression. Art, and particularly theatre, offers a
powerful vehicle through which to undertake this work and the story of the Buddha provides the perfect
backdrop."

Using reading circles, journaling workshops, and mentorship from mental health professionals in collaboration with Ascend Pakistan, the program
promoted resilience, self-expression, and leadership development among participants. The project’s approach centered on building a strong, culturally aware team and fostering community
participation to ensure relevance and impact. I worked with mental health professionals who understand
Pakistan’s societal barriers and engaged local leaders, parents, teachers, and the girls themselves in
shaping the program. Together, we designed interactive workshops that integrated mental health
education with practical coping tools within a supportive environment that reduced stigma and
encouraged peer connection.  For me, peace is not just the absence of conflict but the presence of fairness, equality, and dignity for all.
It means creating conditions where all people, especially girls and women, can live free of fear, express
themselves fully, and pursue their dreams without barriers imposed by society. My project contributes to
peace by addressing the silent struggles of young women in Pakistan, particularly the stigma around
mental health and the lack of leadership opportunities. In the short term, the project created safe spaces
where girls could openly share their experiences, gain coping strategies, and feel connected to a
supportive community. To ensure long-term sustainability, we trained peer leaders and equipped them
with resources. We provided them with toolkits that included workshop outlines, reading materials, and
guidance on leading discussions. By empowering girls within the community to become leaders, the
project reduces dependency on external facilitators and builds local ownership. This approach not only
sustains the program but also creates a ripple effect, as peer leaders mentor future participants, expand
outreach, and adapt activities to evolving needs within their communities."

disabilities in rural Turkmenistan by equipping them with digital design and 3D modeling skills. Working in
partnership with American Space Mary, we provided hands-on training, tablets, and access to 3D printing
technology for 27 participants, fostering both technical knowledge and a supportive community. I initially set out to provide information and guidance on higher education pathways for youth with physical
disabilities in Turkmenistan. Our original plan focused on college preparation and scholarship guidance. However, systemic barriers
made this unrealistic and potentially discouraging for participants. In response, we shifted to teaching 3D
modeling and printing—an area that gave participants tangible skills, confidence, and career possibilities.
This adjustment kept us aligned with the project’s core goal of empowerment while respecting the lived
realities of our community. This project opened my eyes to the depth of systemic discrimination faced by people with disabilities
in my home country, but also showed me their incredible resilience and eagerness to learn when given
access to tools. It challenged me to think creatively about how to adapt when facing structural barriers,
and it inspired me to pursue design not only as a personal career path but also as a medium for
empowerment and social impact. “This project taught me that true empowerment isn't about giving people what we think they need, but
about listening to their realities and adapting to meet them with practical, tangible skills. It was a powerful
lesson in resilience and the transformative potential of a supportive community. By shifting our focus from
college preparation to tangible skills like 3D modeling, we learned to meet people where they are, giving
them the tools and confidence to build their own path forward.”"

scholarship guidance, and mentorship opportunities. The project used a combination of a responsive
website, a 24/7 AI-powered chatbot, and anonymized mentorship sessions to provide safe and
continuous access to information for those barred from traditional schooling.
AccessEd was created in response to the shared reality of many Afghan girls whose education has been
severely restricted. Their stories and challenges informed every step of this project’s design, making it a
collective effort to build solutions for those who face systemic barriers.
In partnership with the nonprofit Applied Ethics, we developed an approach centered on privacy, ethical
storytelling, and building trust with participants. Each participant was given an anonymous nickname,
creating a safe space to engage freely. We hosted weekly workshops and meetings that introduced
participants to scholarship research, study skills, and digital literacy. Because participants came from
different educational backgrounds, I provided tailored resources and materials to help them stay engaged
and up to speed.  I define peace as the creation of conditions where individuals can thrive without fear, exclusion, or
systemic barriers. Peace is not simply the absence of conflict, it is the presence of opportunity, dignity,
and a sense of belonging.This project has profoundly changed how I think about technology and social impact. It showed me that building tools for vulnerable communities is not just a technical challenge, it is an ethical responsibility. I am leaving this experience with a deeper commitment to designing technology that protects users, builds
trust, and contributes to lasting change. More than anything, AccessEd has inspired me to continue
developing solutions that are not only innovative but also sustainable and just."

By pairing young people with elders to co-create a recipe book and podcast, the project documented unique food traditions threatened by industrial expansion and environmental degradation, while advocating for the environmental, health, and cultural rights of traditional communities that continue to live in harmony with nature. My definition of peace has been inspired by the Indigenous Latin American philosophy of sumak kawsay or buen vivir (“good living”), which emphasizes harmony not only among human beings but also between humans and the natural world. Peace, in this sense, extends beyond the mere absence of conflict— it encompasses relational, ecological, and social balance, where communities and individuals can thrive together while respecting the environment. This project contributed to peace on multiple levels. In the short term, it created safe, collaborative spaces for dialogue and learning across generations. By pairing young people with elders through a mentor-apprenticeship model, participants developed mutual trust, strengthened social bonds, and reinforced respect for traditional knowledge. In the long term, the project seeks to preserve cultural heritage and environmental wisdom, empowering the community to assert their rights, sustain their food practices, and resist ecological injustice. By documenting and celebrating traditional food knowledge, the project promotes environmental stewardship and a sense of collective agency— foundations for lasting peace and resilience."
2290,AI Strengthening Healthcare Access (AISHA),Lehigh University,Juliana Magarelli,Makeni,"8.886050,-12.044170",Health & Wellbeing,,Technology Innovation & Tools,,No,"We chose to address the lack of accessible, context-specific healthcare education for healthcare
workers in Sierra Leone. Limited access to training contributes to preventable deaths, high maternal and infant mortality, and weak systems for professional development. During earlier exploration, clinicians voiced frustration about gaps in knowledge and strong interest in more continuous, practical education. AISHA was designed to close this gap by combining trusted medical content with voice-powered conversational technology. AISHA delivers AI-powered voice devices to expand access to medical knowledge for healthcare workers in low-resource, connectivity-limited settings. These devices provide real-time answers, learning tools, quizzes, and patient simulations to strengthen decision-making and improve care delivery. Offline, interactive, and bilingual in English and Krio (in beta), it creates opportunities for active learning, especially for workers with limited literacy. In contrast to one-off trainings or static posters, AISHA provides ongoing, adaptable support that aligns with how people learn on the job.To us, peace is rooted in the commitment to uphold human rights, especially the right to health.
We encountered a significant conflict when faced with the decision to abandon Alexa and start over with custom devices. Months of work had gone into the Alexa version, but it could not function offline. Restarting from scratch was a difficult decision, but by prioritizing user realities, we demonstrated grit and adaptability. The result was a device ready in time for pilots, with enthusiastic uptake by clinicians. True peace is not just the absence of conflict but the presence of systems that ensure dignity, equity, and opportunity. Access to healthcare is a cornerstone of human well-being, and without it, the foundation of lasting peace is fragile.

relationship between migrant teens and Uruguayans at Uruguayan High Schools. The objective is to reach teenagers in a medium they are familiar with: videogames and thus fostering understanding with their migrant peers. The objective is to make an interactive experience which will
develop further discussions about their relationships. For me, peace is more than silence. It’s mutual respect, dignity, connection, and the everyday actions
that allow us to grow together without exclusion. In the short term, Another Shore gives students a
moment to walk in someone else’s shoes. In the long term, it has the potential to shape how students
build relationships.

neighborhood in West Baltimore City, through the establishment of a Breakfast Program and the planning
and construction of a preliminary outdoor kitchen space. The project was purposefully rooted in an ethos
of community kinship and care, aiming to create open dialogue in which all community members have an
active say and voice in the construction of the outdoor space.
The beginnings of this project stemmed from interests in the Black Panther Party’s free Breakfast
program. As a young scholar and believer in forms of mutual aid, particularly within minoritized
communities, the breakfast program implemented by the Panthers reflected my interest in the nexus of
food, racial justice, and community scholarship. Having spent significant hours in the classroom, I wished
to expand my learning and see what it might look like to implement a breakfast program in my own
community, a community greatly impacted by structural racism and food insecurity. The community I grew
up in has always been one centered on mutual aid, so I found that being able to bring resources to my
community in the form of gathering over food and providing food allowed me to feel like a reciprocal
member of my community's spaces. The local relationships that developed out of this were incredible to
me, as many of the elders and neighbors on the block told me numerous times about how successful the
programming was, how delicious the breakfast was, and how it was such a joy to see the young people
eating breakfast and socializing with one another. I found older neighbors coming and bringing extra fruits
and vegetables they thought would pair well with whatever we were cooking that day. People were happy
to contribute extra paper plates, and some already wanted to use the grill. When we were building the
shed to store the equipment, many neighbors came to help or at least to chat and keep me company. “Breaking Bread Building Belonging taught me the power of small actions to make a world of difference.  
By sharing meals and building food infrastructure together, I learned that peacebuilding begins with
community care, listening, and creating spaces where everyone’s voice matters.”"

access to safe, sustainable menstrual products. By working with Blink Foundation, Loom Nepal, and GET
Nepal, I implemented workshops in four schools, distributed menstrual kits, and fostered peer mentorship
programs to normalize open conversations about menstruation. While I initially envisioned broader distribution, I adjusted the project’s scale to focus on building a
model in fewer schools. This allowed for deeper engagement, stronger training, and better feedback
collection. An unexpected outcome was that the organizations I partnered with, who had not previously
included menstrual health in their programming, expressed interest in continuing this work after seeing
the impact and demand. This creates opportunities for long-term sustainability.
Reflection
To me, peace means the freedom to live with confidence, access opportunities, and make choices without
barriers. Menstrual stigma becomes a barrier to these freedoms by forcing girls to miss school, lowering
their confidence, and reinforcing inequality. By providing resources and safe spaces for dialogue, my
project aimed to open doors for greater equality and dignity."
2348,Bridging Divides: Reviving Unity and Peace in Kakuma Refugee Camp,Williams College,Agoth Manyang Arol,Kenya,"1.000000,38.000000",Social Cohesion,,Dialogue,,Yes,"This initiative addressed the longstanding intertribal conflict between the Dinka and Nuer communities in
Kakuma Refugee Camp by training peace delegates, organizing a large-scale peace conference, and
establishing sustainable mechanisms for reconciliation. Through dialogue, mentorship, and symbolic
activities like a football match, the project restored trust, fostered unity, and empowered local leaders to
continue peacebuilding efforts beyond the program.
At the start of the project, the number I had in mind was 45 delegates for a 7 day training. However, the overwhelming urge of everyone wanting to join and make a difference made us increase the number to 300 youth and
community leaders from both tribes. Gender and disability inclusion were prioritized in the selection,
which was conducted through interviews. Once admitted, delegates underwent training in mediation, negotiation, and cultural understanding. The next stage was a seven day Community Peace Conference, which was originally projected to host 450 participants, but the desire of community members to
take part led us to accommodate 800 delegates. The weeklong conference featured
lively discussions and skill-sharing workshops. Cultural activities which are common to both communities
like ‘Kabulo’ and ‘Liro’ were central to the event, and a symbolic football match between Dinka’s Koryom
Boys and Nuer’s Bentiu Boys drew over 2,000 spectators, with families sharing side by side. The match
demonstrated unity in action, and spontaneous community contributions—such as drinks and chairs
donated by local business persons—reflected local ownership and enthusiasm.
For one month following the conference, delegates applied their skills to mediate disputes in their neighborhoods while we did the monitoring. A two-day follow-up conference that allowed participants to evaluate progress, address new challenges, and designate official Peace Ambassadors.The two days were mostly run by the delegates themselves while being guided by the project managers, and they
shared with us all the great things they had accomplished during the one-month implementation.
Ambassadors were awarded certificates. My next aim is to build a youth center since a foundation for
peace has been achieved. To me, peace is the courage to heal from wounds of war, the willingness to embrace one another as one
people, and the commitment to create trust and belonging. In Kakuma, peace means dismantling the
barriers that political forces once weaponized and building compassion, trust, and shared belonging.
In the short term, the project gave delegates practical skills, created platforms for dialogue, and sparked
hope across the camp. In the long term, it established peace ambassadors who can sustain reconciliation
efforts within their communities. The project’s greatest value lies in the structures it created—institutions
of trust that will endure beyond my involvement.  This project has shown me that peace is the courage to turn division into unity. By reconnecting the Dinka
and Nuer in Kakuma, we proved that reconciliation is possible even under the weight of history."

The topic of the book is the incarceration camps of Japanese Americans and Americans of Japanese descent, specifically at the Minidoka location, where many Portland-based people went. The purpose of the book is to preserve the voices and stories of survivors, educate the younger generations on this neglected history, and inspire peace in our present global climate. 
We had the rare opportunity of meeting and interviewing two survivors of the camp whose stories we based the book on. From the beginning of this project's conception, our perception of the world had already begun to
change. We were shocked to find out that people of Japanese descent were put into incarceration camps during World War II. We were not taught the horrors of the event and how it impacted the civilians who
were placed in these camps. From this point, we realized the selective nature of education and
discovered the flaws of the world. Additionally, we learned that the selective incarceration of ethnic
Italians and Germans also occurred in Japan during wartime. The existence of incarceration camps in
Japan speaks to the fact that racial discrimination is not an issue specific to America but an issue of fear
breeding injustice, dehumanization, othering, and selectiveness of historical memory. We recognize that
this is a pattern of history that must stop, yet continues to happen time and time again."

space constraints, including one-on-one coaching and flexible use of the training hall. Graduation on August 30 was a powerful celebration of the cohort’s achievements. With certificates in hand,
participants took their places at mini-demo booths, sharing their ventures and receiving public
acknowledgment from mentors, family, and peers. They left with tested business models, live digital

2321,Building Peace Through Art and Storytelling,St. Olaf College,,Arusha,"-3.366670,36.683330",Youth development,,Art & Design,,Yes,"I wrote a children’s book with 32 primary students in Arusha, Tanzania, as part of a peace
education program that combined storytelling, art, and mental health awareness to help children develop
empathy, resilience, and conflict resolution skills.  Over the course of the program, students created stories and artwork that
were later compiled into a book, celebrating their voices and perspectives.
We printed a reasonable amount of copies that we needed for the training including those from
Peace Education Foundation such as Peacemaking Skills for Little Kids, PreK/K - Digital Teacher's Guide,
Creative Conflict Solving for Kids, Grades 3-4 - Digital Teacher's Guide, Peace Scholars: Creative Conflict
Solving, Grade 5 - Digital Teacher's and digital versions were shared with schools and community
partners to extend the project’s reach and enable them to utilize the materials for future training that they
will work on. The book compilation was completed and printed by a local printing enterprise in Tanzania.
I chose to focus on peace education because children in Tanzania, like in many parts of the
world, have little understanding of peace and how they can play a vital role in resolving conflicts at their
community level. I believe that introducing peace concepts early can provide young people with tools for
resilience and community building on the grounds of fairness and equity.
Arusha was selected because of my partnership with the School of St. Jude and Changemakers
Foundation, all of which provided space, staff, and community connections. These organizations played
vital roles, they offered facilitators, recruited students, and helped ensure that the program was integrated
into school and will help promote our work to the broader community including distributing the printed
books.This project inspired me to see peace not as an abstract idea but as something built moment by
moment, through children’s stories, through their drawings, and through their willingness to learn from one
another. I now understand more clearly that a peaceful future is one where every child is given the tools
and opportunities to become a peacemaker in their own community.

caste-based water discrimination that denied Dalits access to clean water. The project involved building
six communal taps in the Dalit settlement, connected through pipelines from Raage village. By ensuring
reliable water access, the project reduced tensions between castes, eliminated the need for Dalits to use
restricted taps, and promoted dignity and health. The work was carried out in partnership with the Udaan
Foundation, with approval from the Ward 1 government authorities, and in collaboration with a contracted
plumbing team from Bardibas.  For this project, peace was not defined as immediate integration of castes at the same water source.
Instead, peace meant reducing conflict and violence by ensuring that Dalits had their own secure water
supply. Thus, peace is a process rather than a single moment. This practical approach created dignity
and safety for Dalits, while opening the door for future dialogue toward deeper social integration.

The project revealed how reality often diverges from written proposals. Unexpected conflicts,
absenteeism, and adminitrative delays forced quick adaptation. For example, I had to lead and direct online. With time difference and bureaucratic delays, I had to learn to be
patient and consistent with my efforts. Later, I redirected funds meant for my travel to construct a
bathroom and a seating structure near the taps, allowing people to rest and enjoy fresh water together.
These improvisations reminded me the importance of resilience and flexibility."

challenge gender inequality in Yasin, Northern Pakistan, by empowering girls through soccer. In summer 2025, we successfully registered the Academy with the Pakistani Government, conducted a pilot training
camp, started our website building, and purchased land for the Academy. This collaboration laid the
foundation for a resilient and sustainable institution that can continue to grow despite environmental
challenges such as flooding, while advancing gender justice in the region, and taught us to embrace
uncertainty, innovate, and adapt to changing circumstances.
The project was inspired by the backlash against the creation of
the first women’s soccer club in Yasin Valley, which went viral on local media. As best friends from across

1. Flood-Resilient Infrastructure: The land purchase secured a safe, elevated space for the
Academy, protecting it from disasters that destroyed many local facilities.
2. Direct Participation: A pilot camp brought together girls for training and confidence-building,
marking a step forward in community acceptance of women’s sports.
3. Institutional Growth: The Academy is now formally registered, providing legitimacy, recognition,

rural Nepal by building 12 school toilets, delivering menstrual health workshops for 900+ students,
and training 57 women to produce reusable sanitary pads. The project was implemented in
collaboration with United World Schools (UWS) Nepal, the local government of Sankhuwasabha, and
supported by the Davis Projects for Peace grant. We selected the issue of menstrual health and education because it remains one of the most persistent barriers to gender equality in Nepal. In Sankhuwasabha, menstruation is still stigmatized, and girls
often miss school or drop out entirely due to the lack of resources and safe facilities.  “Something that impacted me the most was seeing the boys in the class taking the lead in reminding
their classmates about period awareness. When one person participated, slowly, people who were too
shy to talk about it also started opening up. This showed me how change is possible when the entire
community is involved. Additionally, it reminded all of us that peace isn't just about putting a stop to
conflict; it is about developing as a community to make life better and more comfortable for everyone
living in it.” – Prakriti Manandhar"

in Tamale. The project addressed the systemic barriers facing girls in STEM education by introducing
a tailored curriculum in coding, digital literacy, and problem-solving, while also engaging parents, local
teachers, and local leaders to dismantle cultural barriers and build a sustainable pathway for girls into
technology, fostering a more equitable and innovative community. My decision on the issue to address was rooted in a lifetime of observing the stark educational
inequities in Northern Ghana. I saw brilliant, curious girls like my sisters systematically steered away
from technical fields due to a lack of resources, representation, and deeply ingrained cultural norms.
The approach was twofold: first, to provide direct, hands-on skill-building for the girls to demystify
technology and build confidence; and second, to orchestrate a parallel community engagement
strategy. I knew that without winning the trust and support of parents and local educators, any
technical skills taught would be short-lived. Therefore, the strategy was intentionally holistic, targeting
not just the students but the entire ecosystem that influences their educational choices. the most impactful sessions came from two unexpected
sources: a young female app developer from Accra who joined via Zoom for a short while, and a
female agricultural science student from UDS who demonstrated how she uses data analysis to
improve crop yields. This real-world, Ghanaian-centric application of STEM was more powerful than I
had anticipated, so I pivoted to source more local and relatable role models. For me, peace is not only the absence of violence or conflict—it is the active presence of opportunity,
dignity, and inclusion. When girls are denied access to education, especially in fields like STEM that
shape the future, their exclusion perpetuates cycles of inequality that destabilize families and
communities. By creating spaces where girls could see themselves as capable engineers and
problem-solvers, the project planted seeds of peace that I believe will grow both individually and
collectively. One father told me, ""I always thought this was for boys in the big cities. Now I see my
daughter can do it too."" This dismantling of a prejudicial belief is a direct act of building peace."
2320,Community Greenhouse - Climate Adaptive Mountain Vegetable Farming ,St. Lawrence University,Hishi Bista,Upper Mustang,"29.083000,83.917000",Ag & Food Security,Environment & Climate,Infrastructure,Educational Enrichment,No,"This project, in Ghami, Upper
Mustang, Nepal, addressed community food insecurity and lack of access to fresh vegetables during
harsh winters. By building a greenhouse with the Ama Soma Mothers’ Club and local partners, the
project created a sustainable solution that empowers women, strengthens community ties, and improves
nutrition. I chose to address the issue of nutrition deficiency and food insecurity in Ghami,
where families often survive on barley, buckwheat, and potatoes for months due to heavy snow and travel
restrictions. The lack of dietary variety has long-term impacts on health, particularly for children and
mothers. The physical project building process lasted a total of two weeks, including travel
from Kathmandu to Ghami. The greenhouse itself was constructed over 10 days of active building. The
workforce combined local skills and community engagement: 10 workers in total contributed, including 7
members of the Ama Soma Mothers’ Club, 3 local villagers with construction experience, and the local
building expert, Jayang Khetuk. Community members carried stones, prepared mud, and supported the
labor effort, while mothers took on both physical and organizational roles to ensure progress remained on
track. The mayor of the rural municipality also joined the celebration at the project’s completion,
underscoring the local government’s recognition and support. In all, the project represented a genuine
collaboration between villagers, leaders, and skilled builders, reinforcing community ownership of the
greenhouse.  One conflict we faced was the physical strain of carrying stones, which tested everyone’s strength and
patience. The work was exhausting, especially in the thin mountain air, and at times it felt overwhelming.
But rather than allowing this to create frustration, we turned it into a shared challenge. We rotated tasks,
encouraged one another, and even turned breaks into mini-celebrations with food, laughter, and music.
This reminded me that conflict is not always about disagreement—it can also be about hardship, and the
way people respond to hardship can either divide or unite them. In this case, it became a source of
solidarity.""Building the greenhouse in my hometown of Ghami showed me that peace begins with meeting simple
human needs like food security. Working with the Ama Soma Mothers’ Club taught me that true resilience
and sustainability come from empowering local communities to take ownership. This project has not only
given my village hope for the winters ahead, but has also shaped how I view the meaning of peace in
practice."""

of past injustices and the effects they have on communities. The way in which radioactive contamination
spreads from fallout and sediments to living organisms is an important ecological topic that has been
recognized both among the scientific community and beyond, specifically through the Treaty on the
Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (TPNW), which requires environmental remediation and assistance for
victims of nuclear weapons tests.In a time of global unrest with wars in Europe and the Middle East, conversations surrounding nuclear
weapons have attracted a new wave of attention. While luckily no residual radiation has been found in fish
from the Kwajalein Atoll, this project helps confront and bring attention to the often overlooked long term
consequences, such as contamination, from nuclear weapons, which can last for centuries and have
serious and widespread health impacts. In a world where a nuclear war has become much more of a
distinct possibility, this project aimed to emphasize that it is our collective responsibility to ensure the
health and wellbeing of all communities, especially those that are marginalized or overlooked, and to hold
world powers accountable for their actions."

through communal cycles of reciprocity and gratitude where every individual contributes and has a sense
of belonging and purpose. The traditional practices of natural dyeing and weaving in Teotitlán del Valle
embody this vision of peace by fostering intergenerational relationships rooted in patience, reciprocity,
and care. Participating in this project was the most rewarding experience of my life as it nurtured my growth as an
organizer, an educator, a student, and a human being. My interest in Oaxacan textiles began from an
academic and research-based perspective, as well as an artistic curiosity to understand how textile
practices withstand periods of conflict and erasure through nurturing connections across generations,
spaces, and even species. The artistic and ecological community engagement at the heart of this project

But art –
the very process of creation – has been transformative for the very reasons it is overlooked. Creating
together asks for a social dreaming-of, and dreaming-up, that is based on and grounds us in the real
worlds we live in. Creativity in Action is a grassroots organizing effort that enlists socially engaged art practices to address
the socio-ecological disruption faced by campesino communities in Norcasia, Caldas, after the
construction of a megadam in the region. Through collaborative workshops, cultural programming, and
collaborative filmmaking, the integrated arts project has encouraged dialogue and reflection on water
insecurity and displacement, inviting communities from three villages to participate in an exercise of
collective remembering.   For the past three months, my definition of peace for this project has remained largely the same – it is and
has been a process of regeneration and healing through and beyond conflict, be it through community
screenings or extended interviews with individuals. Beyond situating community members within
self-made narratives and histories that affirm their own experiences of conflict, displacement, and water
scarcity, these past few months of assisting documentation efforts have also situated me as an
intermediary between this reality that is urgent, complex, and disjointed, and realities I have had the
fortunate opportunity to peek into during my education in the Global North, realities defined by
convenience and comfort. The idea of peace as regenerative is not necessarily a passive one. I believe
that regeneration is necessary work for grassroots organizing – political processes, no matter how big or
small, require the unity and consensus of its collective. What I hope we have done through this project is
strengthen the foundation for such processes of positive change."

Through interviews with healthcare professionals, community leaders, and
patients, I identified key barriers faced by rural and Indigenous communities. These insights, combined
with national data showing high incidence and mortality rates due to cervical cancer, informed the design
of a three-part program: (1) community education and engagement, (2) screening and treatment, and (3)
follow-up care. Through conversations with community leaders and patients, I knew that culturally tailored
educational materials in Spanish and Kichwa were essential. My project contributes to peace by bridging the
gap between Western and traditional medicine through deep listening and collaboration with community
health leaders, local doctors, and residents. By creating dialogue and understanding where mistrust
originates, how it has been shaped over time, and how communities perceive healthcare, we sought to
co-create solutions rather than impose them. This approach strengthens relationships, empowers
communities to take charge of their health outcomes, and lays the foundation for long-term peace and
equitable healthcare.Additionally, the project enabled women to take ownership of their own health. This empowerment is, in my eyes, an expression of peace. “Implementing this project showed me that sustainable change begins with co-creating solutions.
By combining culturally grounded education with accessible screening, treatment, and follow-up care, we
helped women reclaim ownership of their health in underserved communities–and yet there is still so
much more to do. Ecuador has become a second home to me, and I am committed to returning to
continue and expand this work!”"
2304,Cultivating Community: Transforming the Jonquil Hotel Courtyard,Northwestern University,Lily Shen,Chicago,"41.850030,-87.650050",Social Cohesion,,Art & Design,Infrastructure,No,"My project renovated the neglected courtyard of a Chicago homeless shelter and transformed it into a
vibrant, safe, and inviting community space. My approach was to design and implement a courtyard renovation at Good News Partners’ Jonquil Hotel, a shelter for women and families in Rogers Park. The project created a basketball playing area, picnic
benches and a grill for shared meals, a bike rack stocked with refurbished bicycles, and a tile art project
created by shelter residents. Each element was chosen with input from residents, ensuring the courtyard
reflected their priorities rather than an outside vision imposed on them. By inviting residents to co-create
and lead the renovation process, I sought to foster ownership of the space and empower residents as
community builders.  I define peace as the ability of people to live with dignity in community with one another,
supported by spaces that foster connection, joy, and mutual care. Peace is not only the absence of
conflict but the presence of belonging.
 In the short term, the project immediately reduced
isolation. Children now ride bikes together after school; teenagers gather for pickup basketball games;
adults sit at picnic tables to talk, cook, and eat. In the long term, the courtyard will contribute to peace by
fostering community life in tangible, everyday ways.
This project stretched me as a leader. I managed construction logistics,
coordinated volunteers, mediated conflicts, and built relationships across nonprofit and community
partners. There were days when I was mounting benches in the sun, others when I was examining budget
reallocations, and still others when I was facilitating childcare while paint dried nearby. Each challenge
deepened my confidence in myself and my abilities.
In addition, this project taught me the importance of reintroducing beauty and dignity into people’s lives.
Too often, responses to homelessness focus only on meeting basic needs like food and shelter. While
these are essential, people also deserve spaces that are uplifting, peaceful, and beautiful."

outcomes, and resource management within Indigenous communities in Malaysia through a combination
of data collection, capacity-building workshops, and partnership development. We worked directly with community leaders, villagers, and
relevant stakeholders to strengthen inter-village ties and collaboration, while also equipping participants
with the skills and confidence to engage constructively with external stakeholders. While the proposal included land rights research, we found these issues to be complex, politicised, and
requiring expertise beyond our team’s capacity. Direct involvement risked creating sensitivities or
jeopardising access to communities. Instead, we focused on strengthening communication and
collaboration skills, enabling communities to problem-solve internally and engage constructively with
stakeholders already working on land rights. Similarly, although formal partnerships with government and
NGOs were envisioned, time and resource constraints led us to prioritise intra- and inter-village
collaboration, laying a foundation for future advocacy and partnerships.The experience reminded us that peacebuilding requires humility, patience, and cultural sensitivity. It also
challenged us to balance ambition with realism, redirecting our efforts from complex land issues to areas
where we could make meaningful contributions. Small actions like cross-village networking or safe spaces
for dialogue proved powerful in sparking collaboration.
Ultimately, the project inspired us to continue using training and capacity-building as tools for peace,
reinforcing that peace is not a destination but an ongoing process of relationship-building, respect, and
resilience."

However, early on we found that the highly competitive low-income job market in India is highly inelastic
and therefore marginal income growth from investment into formal training would not have incrementally
positive return. For this reason, we looked for ideas with a similar ethos of increasing skills and earning
potential while adding a constraint of providing a high return on funding investment. Using the idiom “give
a man a fish, he eats for a day, teach them to fish, they eat forever” as inspiration, we organized a 2 week
long hackathon-like competition. With technology being the preeminent tool of our time, the focus of our
competition is to get students to envision how technology can be used to create solutions that solve
contemporary problems at large and within their local communities.
By partnering with Airtel Foundation’s schools’ arm we were
able to bring together 64 students from 7 schools in Punjab to work in teams of up to 5 to envision tech-power solutions. The students in the process were able to learn about key technology capabilities including basics, the internet and AI whilst also developing their problem solving and communication skills. We are very happy with the volume of participation and most important the quality of the ideas generated by the students
validated that incredible potential is being constrained simply due to a lack of access to infrastructure. Seeing students create fully fledged prototypes such as video games, tech-powered sanitation solutions and bicycle safety solutions was invigorating. With the successful orchestration of the competition and distribution of devices, we believe that this
concept is a validated form of driving mobility and peace in the world."

in Preveza, Greece to address the lack of resources for STEM education and opportunities at the school.
Working with these stakeholders, we co-designed the lab, acquired materials and equipment for the lab,
created draft curricula to guide how the materials can be used in a class setting, and organized
workshops to ensure successful uptake and engagement with the lab. In the short term, we
strengthened connections with the Preveza community and with the Music School, and we launched a
science lab that will allow young people to pursue expanded pathways. For some individuals, this may be
a spark that allows them to truly thrive in their lives, and possibly find career paths that align with them.
Being able to offer a more rounded curriculum at the Music School will also allow the school to support
students more fully. We hope this creates a virtuous cycle where students in the community find success
through opportunities that go beyond their music. We also hope that the project over the long term will
help foster science, knowledge and understanding that contributes positively to society. This project showed us that minor inefficiencies can pile up to become structural barriers that truly inhibit
the ability of some communities to acquire the opportunities that others have. Bureaucratic approvals,
oftentimes contradicting from one entity to another, lead to huge wait times for the deliveries. We saw this
when banking policy contradicted WPI’s ordering policy, which contradicted the tariffs imposed by the US
government, which affected our project budget – the friction caused by the accumulated inefficiencies and
contradictions gave us a first hand view of what it looks like to try to overcome global inequalities.
Science is not the information written in books and on white boards, but the understanding and utilization
of the natural world around us, something remarkable, resembling magic even to the most knowledgeable
of people. Making sure the younger generations understand this is a key to ensuring a brighter and

short documentary film combining interviews, archival materials, and artistic collaborations. The project
raised awareness of Syrian prison survivors, engaged local and international communities through a
movie screening and discussions, and laid the groundwork for launching a nonprofit, Beyond Saydnaya,
to provide long-term support to survivors.Working on this project taught me that peace begins when survivors’ voices are heard, validated, and
supported. Documenting Omar’s story was a powerful first step, but the real work extends beyond a
single narrative—it means ensuring that thousands of others like him, whose experiences have been
silenced, are remembered and given the resources to heal.
I learned that telling a story is not enough; it must be paired with action, advocacy, and community
engagement to create change. This project deepened my understanding that peace requires more than
the end of violence—it demands structures of care and accountability that honor survivors’ experiences.
Ultimately, this experience showed me that peace is relational, ongoing, and active. Even small efforts—a
documentary, a screening, a conversation—can spark broader awareness and action. True peace is
inseparable from empathy, advocacy, and sustained care."

the country learned about Rwanda's Peace and Reconciliation Journey since the 1994 Genocide against
the Tutsi. As the youth were born post-genocide, there is a growing issue of misinformation, lack of
awareness, genocide denial, and revisionism. Hence, through academic books, guest speakers, field
trips, and their ""Peace Projects,” students learned in-depth about Rwanda's peace process.  After this project, I am reminded of my belief that peace is a societal decision to heal and rebuild, one that
must be intergenerational and include post-conflict generations to ensure that violence does not resurface
and that stability is sustainable. Overall, this project has made me deeply value the perspectives and knowledge production of youth. I was genuinely impressed by their peace projects and the level of detail, thoughtfulness, and creativity they demonstrated. When developing policy solutions, we rarely consult or refer to youth, yet some of
their project ideas demonstrated such remarkable critical thinking and creativity that they merit serious
consideration.

I have always wanted to return to my country and empower youth at home. When I observed the rise of
online ethnic tensions linked to the conflict in Congo, I recognized the urgent need to raise awareness
about Rwanda’s peace and reconciliation journey. This project was particularly valuable because it
reminded youth that peace is not a static achievement but an intergenerational effort. I am convinced that
this project represents a meaningful step toward creating a lasting echo of peace in Rwanda, one that will

reality is that not everyone will share the same sense of urgency or empathy for the issues you care
about.Hoping that EcoEcho’s workshops and environmental education curricula would foster new
relationships between vulnerable children and nature, I have witnessed both inspiring connections
and significant implementation challenges. These experiences have shown me that with sufficient
guidance and thoughtful facilitation, children and families can develop greater interest in the outdoors
and experience its physical and mental health benefits. Most importantly, this journey continues to
motivate me to seek realistic and impactful solutions that support the marginalized communities I care

Our project helped restore peace by addressing the economic and emotional vulnerabilities that make women susceptible to domestic violence. Providing pigs, yes, but more importantly, providing voice, skills, and solidarity. That is the peace we built together in Gateko. The most difficult moment came during the selection of participants. Some community members who were not chosen felt left out, causing tension that could have jeopardized trust in the project. We quickly responded by openly sharing our selection criteria and emphasizing that every family would eventually benefit through the piglet-sharing model. I learned that transparency and humility are essential when working with vulnerable populations. Conflict can be resolved not just through theory, but through action, empathy, and inclusion.
Before this project, I thought of peace as a lofty concept tied to big political change. But I now understand peace as something personal and local. A woman with a pig, new skills, and a supportive group can shift the trajectory of her family. That ripple effect is real.

approach enabled women to rebuild their livelihoods while also finding space to process the
trauma of displacement. For displaced women in Burkina Faso, peace is not abstract. It means being able to feed their
families, to have their voices heard, and to remain rooted in community despite the fractures
caused by violence. A goat, a garden, or a weaving circle is more than just a source of livelihood; it
is a way to reclaim dignity, visibility, and belonging.  This project was not only a local initiative but a gesture of love, memory, and engagement for the
Africa we want; an Africa where women are not only helped, but also listened to and placed in the
spotlight as leaders of their own futures. Through Empowered to Thrive, I learned that peace is
built in small, practical acts that restore dignity: a goat, a garden, or a weaving circle can open

For the Indigenous children, peace is the ability to live without displacement and marginalization. This project contributes to peace by creating the access and opportunity an individual needs to find peace. It created a safe and supportive environment where Indigenous children can access education, a fundamental tool for empowerment and self-determination.  This project restored access to education for Indigenous children in the flood-affected Chengi Ideal School in the Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT) in Khagrachari, Bangladesh, by rebuilding student dormitories, introducing eco-friendly transportation and supplying school materials for 147 students and 17 teachers. The project was implemented collaboratively with local leaders, school officials, and Indigenous diaspora community.  Home to over 54 Indigenous groups totaling approximately 1.65 million people, the CHT remains one of the most marginalized regions of Bangladesh, a situation worsened by 1980s settlement policies that displaced Indigenous communities from their land. The region also faces heightened vulnerability to climate change, where frequent flash floods and extreme weather further threaten already fragile infrastructure. The project addressed the urgent need to restore education for Indigenous children in the CHT, where systemic exclusion and climate-related vulnerabilities limit access to schooling. The short-term approaches included rebuilding infrastructure and providing essential educational resources to ensure continuity of learning, while the long-term approach focused on sustaining transportation and dormitory facilities to enable students from remote areas to attend school.

employment by equipping them with the tools and knowledge needed to navigate the job market by
developing the skills and confidence to acquire an internship or part-time job.I observed that for many of the young athletes involved, individuals who had spent years dedicated to
training and competition, often with little preparation for life beyond sports, this experience was
especially transformative. The event helped bridge the gap between athletic and professional careers
by demonstrating how the discipline, resilience, teamwork, and goal-setting developed through sports
are highly transferable to the workforce. Participants learned how to articulate these strengths as
valuable assets, enhancing their confidence in job interviews, workplace settings, and academic
environments.
As they begin to access more stable income sources and long-term opportunities, these
individuals are also better able to support their families and contribute to their communities, helping
to break long-standing cycles of economic vulnerability."

We worked alongside local partners and supporters to strengthen business skills and community engagement. Our approach was immersive and innovative; therefore, we blended hands‐on workshops, bank‐led financial literacy + know your customer support, market‐readiness activities, and a mental health/self‐esteem module.  A recurring tension surfaced between formal banking requirements and familiar cash/mobile‐money routines. We addressed this by co‐teaching with bank staff, translating fee schedules into plain language, offering low‐fee product options, and running on‐site verification to remove friction. We also encountered gendered expectations voiced by some male instructors, reflecting broader social norms around women’s “appropriate” roles in the household and marketplace. In informal conversations, we heard doubts about “investing in women who will soon marry” and concerns that
confident, economically active women might intimidate men. Such views can dampen aspirations and subtly gatekeep access to opportunity. We addressed this through dialogue-based facilitation, ground rules that center respect and voice, and myth-versus-fact exercises on gender and enterprise. We also used Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie’s TED Talk “We Should All Be Feminists” as an anchor for small-group reflection on equity, shared prosperity, and why feminism affirms equal dignity and choice, not opposition to men. While shifts were gradual, we observed more supportive classroom behaviors and stronger peer advocacy by the end of the program.
We were challenged to listen first and adapt fast, accepting that success can look different than on paper. The most inspiring moments were the business plan presentations and pitches, as well as the graduation day, when voices that began quietly closed with conviction. We leave with deeper respect for co‐design with local institutions and for the power of
transparent, user‐centered financial inclusion."

The program emphasized two complementary pillars: leadership and volunteerism, both of which serve as pathways to fostering a peaceful and inclusive society.

The initiative brought together 40 secondary school students from eight high schools across six municipalities of Timor-Leste. The participants engaged for one week in workshops, discussions, and interactive activities designed to equip them with knowledge and practical skills to address challenges such as gender equality, civic engagement, mental health awareness, social inclusion, and education access. These topics were carefully chosen to be relevant and current, ensuring participants understood the realities of their communities and were prepared to lead before engaging in volunteerism or community-based initiatives.

Leadership was emphasized as a core pathway to peace. Participants learned to communicate effectively, think critically, and collaborate across differences. Sessions on public speaking, conflict resolution, and civic engagement provided practical tools for students to act as responsible leaders within their schools and communities. By combining theoretical knowledge with interactive exercises, students gained confidence and a clearer understanding of how leadership can promote harmony, inclusivity, and problem-solving at both local and municipal levels.

Volunteerism was introduced as the practical application of leadership. Activities and discussions highlighted the importance of service to others and the impact of youth-led initiatives in fostering community cohesion. Participants explored how acts of service, ranging from environmental clean-ups to awareness campaigns, can build unity, empathy, and a culture of peace. Through these experiences, students realized that volunteering is not only a responsibility but also a powerful tool for creating positive change.

A central component of the camp was enabling participants to design their own project initiatives for implementation in their schools and communities. Working in small groups, students identified challenges relevant to their local context and created action plans to address them.

that promote justice and prosperity. In my view, peace is not merely the absence of conflict, it’s the
presence of opportunity. It’s the moment a young woman realizes she has the right and the ability to
make decisions about her life, future, and finances. Furthermore, peace is built when knowledge replaces
fear, and when access to tangible tools allows one to imagine a future rooted and solidified in dignity and
autonomy. The decision to focus on financial education came from conversations with friends, family members,
community peers, and youth in Concepción who shared and voiced concerns about not knowing how to
manage money, save, or plan for their future. Additionally, the lack of understanding of the official banking
system and its bureaucratic process has led many neighbors to turn to financial entities with less
bureaucracy but greater monetary risk. This has been the reality for many
women who, in search of a decent income, have fallen into scams and debts at an early age. In this
context and understanding the growing and latent challenges affecting my community, the idea of crafting
a contextualized financial education project for female high school students was born. The aim was to
provide practical, dynamic, and decentralized financial education including tools and resources that will
protect future generations from economic and social vulnerability. The project had two key components: a
theoretical one and a practical one. After recognizing that financial literacy is a powerful tool for
autonomy, we incorporated group dynamics, intergenerational mentorship, and visual materials to ensure
the learning experience was both accessible and meaningful."

and direct experience with its consequences. Growing up in post-communist Romania, I witnessed how
the lack of financial education disproportionately affected rural communities and women, fostering cycles
of dependency, abuse, and vulnerability. I decided to focus on financial education as a peace-building tool
because I believe it empowers individuals with the knowledge to achieve independence, reduce
vulnerability to exploitation, and challenge systemic inequalities. My strategy was to partner with
FeminEast, an emerging NGO already trusted by local communities, to create a free online curriculum
and deliver in-person workshops to students between 14 and 35 years old. By targeting students, we are
able to instill the basics of financial education from an early age, equipping them with the tools to make
informed decisions, avoid cycles of dependency, and build a foundation for long-term independence and
community resilience. This blended approach allowed us to combine broad digital access with personal
community engagement. Our methodology was centered on participant feedback and culturally relevant
resources, ensuring the project directly met the needs of young women and minorities.  This project has reinforced my belief that education is one of the most powerful tools for social
change and community building. It challenged me to think about peace not in abstract terms, but in
practical, everyday actions like teaching someone how to manage their finances and have an emergency
savings account, which can ripple into greater autonomy, reduced violence, and stronger communities. It
inspired me to view leadership as a collaborative effort, where listening to local voices and building trust
are just as important as designing a curriculum. With the support of volunteers, experts, and students, we
were able to take the first step toward financial empowerment."

GoForTansania which connected us to the Brilliant Pre-Primary and Primary school in Ushirika,
Tanzania. The Tanzanian school is fully funded by GoForTansania in cooperation with the German High
School Gymnasium Mainz Oberstadt (GMO).
 For the first branch, we organized school lessons that provided political,
historic and sustainable information for German students at GMO. For that, we recruited experts from
these fields to provide professional insights into topics like the German-Tanzanian Political Relations,
the History of German Colonialism in Tanzania, and Contemporary Sustainability Issues in Tanzania.
The evaluation of the school lessons revealed great interest from German students in personal
contributions to strengthen the relationship between both countries and to get engaged in the
community to help make the lives of the students in Ushirika easier. Additionally, the exchange between
both schools was fostered by pictures, representing Tanzania, that were drawn by the Tanzanian
students and sent to Germany. To promote the association's visibility, we contributed to its marketing
by using the self-made pictures from Tanzania and created stickers with the association's brand logo.
To help raise funds for the association we funded cans which are spread all over the German school
property and will be used for students to throw out their plastic bottles. Germanys recycle system gives
25 cents for each recycled plastic bottle. This money will be used to continue sustainable funding of the
Tanzanian school. The second branch was addressed by organizing material for the Tanzanian students. One of the achievements was the organization and funding of sewing machines which the
students will learn to use at school. Moreover, we wanted to put emphasis on the needs of the school
in Tanzania. Therefore, we contributed to infrastructural advancements within the housing situation of
the students and future volunteers. Beds as well as mattresses were organized. Moreover, a guestroom
for volunteers was created. For the last branch, Sustainability, we managed to organize solar panels for
the school in Tanzania. This will allow the school to produce their own electricity, which will lower costs

washrooms and clean water, which would result in a safer learning environment for them. This small step
is important to restore dignity and create opportunities for growth as most of the students belong to a
marginalized community. In the short term, the facilities are expected to improve attendance, reduce the
bad odors around the school, build dignity among the students and raise awareness of hygiene. In the long
term, the project would support the commitment towards SDG 6 for Nepal, protect the environment and
provide basic sanitation facilities to generations of students to study at the Basanta Primary School. “If we look around the world, there are countless opportunities to make a difference in people’s lives, but it
is also a fact that everyone’s problem cannot be solved. Too often, we forget how privileged we are,
because the things we consider ‘normal’ such as clean water, a safe bathroom and dignity are luxuries for
many. Across the globe, there are people who wake up every day wishing for the simple comforts we take

teenagers get academic support and encouragement, while also engaging in enjoyable summer activities
that promote inclusion, cultural immersion and respect as members of the broader Macedonian society. In terms of the strategies we implemented hand-in-hand with the NGO, our project mainly fostered
connections between Roma youth, educators, and the broader community by creating spaces for
dialogue, collaboration and enjoyment. Our weekly community meetings and feedback sessions
encouraged Roma children to actively engage in their education and share their ideas, challenges,
desires and spaces for improvement. We also collected and showcased their educational and creative
achievements and crafts. Our anticipated short-term outcome increased educational engagement among
the Roma community, with the long-term goal of creating a more inclusive and equitable community for
the Roma youth to grow and thrive in.
Overall our project involved ~45 children, including younger primary school children, who
benefited from tutoring sessions (especially sessions they didn’t have before such as computing lessons)
and various cultural trips. Our weekly schedule included a mix of foundational skill-building activities,
academic sessions, creative workshops integrating arts and science, and excursions to cultural and
educational sites like local museums, libraries and nature destinations. In this project, education served as a foundation for empowerment and breaking
cycles of poverty and barriers that persist for Roma communities in North Macedonia. We achieved short

As a man who managed to come to the U.S., I deeply felt for the girls left behind in Afghanistan and wanted to do something tangible to support them. Having worked in education and being a strong believer in the right to education regardless of gender, I designed the project to combine leadership and advocacy training with hands-on podcast creation, providing participants with the tools, confidence, and platform to reclaim their voices, share their stories, and advocate for education, empowerment, and peace. This project has changed how I used to see education and working with Afghan girls who faced extreme barriers showed me their resilience, curiosity, and hunger for learning. Many were amazed by technology and podcasting, eager to learn despite challenging timing and internet obstacles. Hearing their podcast stories was incredibly inspiring and their courage, creativity, and determination reinforced the power of storytelling and education to drive change and promote peace. This project not only amplified the voices of Afghan girls but also inspired me to deepen my work through my own nonprofit, continuing to contribute to education, empowerment, and the future of Afghan society.

Northern Laikipia, Kenya, by equipping Maasai herders with mobile solar power and a community-led digital
toolset for real-time livestock tracking, geofencing, and climate-aware grazing decisions, paired with training
and dialogue. We worked with IMPACT Kenya, leaders and members of Maiyanat Community Land, to install
the app, run FPIC-based workshops, and co-create a local monitoring group to facilitate feedback and
provide technical support. We focused on reducing
resource competition and associated violence by improving pastoralists’ access to actionable information
(pasture availability, movement patterns) and by creating a practical, shared process for dialogue and
decision-making.
The strategy combined: (1) a mobile app and GPS collars for geofencing/traceability; (2) hands-on digital
literacy sessions and dialogue; and (3) a community-run channel (WhatsApp + committee oversight) for peer
support and rapid feedback.  Peace is the capacity of communities to manage scarce resources fairly and access information easily, with
trusted channels for dialogue and problemsolving, so that disputes de-escalate into mediation and
cooperation instead of violence.

In the short-term, there was a high local uptake of the app, formal FPIC approval, successful installation on
all participating phones, hands-on training, and the creation of a community monitoring channel. Herders
immediately used geofencing and real-time views to plan grazing and to track high-value animals (e.g.,
camels and cows), increasing a sense of security and clear access to information. Long term, geofencing
and animal live-tracking data can reduce accidental encroachment, deter theft, and lower the frequency of
climate-induced resource-related confrontations. The Peace Hub will serve as a place of convening, training,
peer learning and co-managing tools.  The project made me understand that no matter how good an idea is, it will only create positive impact when

project contributes to peace by reducing the destabilizing effects of preventable disease. When market
women are healthy, they can continue providing for their children, keeping them in school and preventing
the economic hardship that often leads to instability. In the short term, peace was visible in the relief of
women who understood their health risks for the first time. In the long term, peace will be visible in
stronger families and more resilient communities. Not everything was easy. One challenge we
encountered was skepticism from some market women, who initially feared that screenings might lead to
hidden costs or stigmatization. We navigated this by working closely with respected community leaders
and market queens, who publicly endorsed the project and reassured women of its benefits. This
experience taught me that building trust is as important as providing services, and that effective
community health work must be rooted in cultural respect and relationships."

from seeking testing, care, and open conversation. We created and implemented Guhuza, an
UNO-inspired HIV awareness card game, alongside peer discussions and student-led facilitation, reaching ~300 university students and ~30 high school students in Kigali and Rwamagana through multiple local
partnerships. Student facilitators are now equipped to run future sessions with the provided decks, facilitator
guide, and SOPs. Based on feedback, we plan to develop a Kinyarwanda edition, create tiered
difficulty decks, and expand the model to cover life skills and mental health topics. Peace means enabling dignity and inclusion—creating environments where stigma is dismantled and
individuals can speak openly without fear. In the short term, participants practiced naming HIV confidently and challenging misconceptions in respectful peer discussions. In the long term, normalizing conversation among youth helps reduce stigma, encouraging care-seeking and supporting healthier communities. We learned that sustainable peacebuilding looks less like one-off campaigns and more like small, replicable mechanisms embedded in communities. Seeing student leaders execute with
professionalism reminded us of the untapped capacity within youth networks, and confirmed that
empowering them is key to long-term change. Personal Statements"

Through a Spanish English book, Una Voz de Esperanza: 20 Stories From The Inland Empire, this project documented local community members and organizers associated with Inland Coalition for Immigrant Justice (IC4IJ), in their pursuit to thrive and work within their neighborhoods in the Inland Empire. At the book celebration held in September, I
witnessed how this project contributed to peace in how confident and self-assured participants were. I
saw their family members and friends look at them with such pride and recognition, that these community
members are seen, heard, and their words eternalized. A conflict I endured during this project included
using photographs that make people feel safe and secure during this time of fear and facial recognition
used against immigrant bodies. Thus, while there were many times, I captured beautiful portraits, I also had to prepare photos that provided more obscurity to their identity in respect to their privacy and safety.
Thus, the most ‘aesthetic’ photo-choice I learned in this project is one that empowers and provides
comfort to the participants. In conducting this project, I found that I have not felt more pride and joy than
when celebrating people’s stories and meeting with people. I hope to continue this work of storytelling

young people, inspire creativity, and promote peace.
The Innovation for Peace (I4P) Ethiopia project aimed to promote sustainable peace through the lenses of
innovation and creation of inclusive platforms in prominent public universities in conflict affected setting.
Ultimately, the project aspired to contribute to create local economic opportunities for young
undergraduates, reduce violence, and contribute to long term stability and harmony through young peace
promoters.
Towards this end, the inclusive youth platforms played a vital role to empower aspiring youth entrepreneurs
in social innovation, enhance conflict awareness and youth voice, and develop creative peace building
solutions in the community. Using young people’s passion for innovation and economic independence, the
I4P has created platforms in targeted public universities for youth driven peace contributions through
catalyzing innovation and created favorable spaces for elevating spirit self-employment as a viable career
path thereby contributing to economic diversification and social innovation. It fostered a sense of purpose
among participated student communities and promoted culture of entrepreneurship thereby creating local
solutions for community problems. More importantly, the I4P has facilitated finalists to be a new generation
of youth peace actors who incorporated peace promotion concepts in their business ideas/planning and

create a children’s book celebrating the lives of inspirational Indonesian women, each featured with a
biography and portrait. Co-created with schoolteachers and children aged 7–12, the book included
interactive workbook-style pages to encourage personal reflection and empowerment, inspiring the next
generation of Indonesian children to stand for gender equality, girls’ rights, and peace.  The book wasn’t just written for Indonesian girls–it was written with them. From initial feedback via Zoom and WhatsApp, to joyful brainstorming in the
Jakarta workshops, these community members helped shape every page. Local teachers suggested
historical figures we had overlooked. Children shared stories about their mothers and sisters. Their input
was invaluable, from ensuring a wide variety of careers to determining which achievements and passions
to highlight. Together, we built something rooted in our very own hopes and dreams.
The initial idea was to develop the book entirely in person. But logistical hurdles, particularly with
the timing issue of printing the book, led us to pivot: we began remotely, then convened in Jakarta for an
intensive month-long workshop. That shift unexpectedly broadened participation: it would have been
more difficult to get everyone at the same location, especially considering how large the Greater Jakarta
area is. Because we communicated mostly on Whatsapp, it was actually quite easy to get a variety of
voices, regardless of geographical restrictions. Of course, the remote model came with some setbacks -
there were many tech hiccups, and I felt I couldn’t glean as much richness from the discussions as I could
in real life. But the diversity of perspectives was worth it, and is something I couldn’t get from the real-life
sessions. “I hope this project will have ignited the passion for justice and equality in the hearts of young
readers. Through these conversations and the book, I believe this project has facilitated community
cohesion and liberating conversations, all in the pursuit of peace. This is the true fight for women: a story
unearthed, an intellectual reckoning, the subsumption of courage.”"

needs of Association AGNAWÊ GOMI which are coping with irregular rainfall and learning new farming
techniques, it was clear that building an irrigation system would make the biggest impact. This would
allow them to produce crops year-round without fear of the dry season, diversify their agricultural
production, increase their income, and at the same time receive training in sustainable farming practices.This project contributed to empowering women in a male-centered activity. It gave them a sense of
courage, belonging, and support while bridging the gap of gender inequality and exclusion. At the same
time, it helped restore some of the societal damage caused by the ongoing security crisis in Burkina
Faso. By offering training on irrigation system maintenance and sustainable farming practices, the women
gained the authority to independently manage the infrastructure. This knowledge boosted both their
productivity and annual revenue. In many ways, our project contributed to peace by restoring dignity,

While the Kel Chai Ich project supported higher education aspirations, it also built understanding
between parents and students. In Kyrgyzstan, family decision-making is central, so we embraced this
by providing shared language and information for families to discuss opportunities together. We
worked directly with parents, inviting them to workshops where we shared opportunities for their
daughters and encouraged them to become advocates. Parents inspired by our discussions
volunteered to chaperone a three-day field trip, building trust and collaboration. This year, 15 parents

deforestation, and pain caused by smoke in a neglected community in Kachene, Mozambique. I worked
with Mysol Moçambique to provide 66 solar panel kits to the community and 3 to the local primary school.

It is estimated that about 300 people were positively impacted by the project. They no longer need to start their day earlier because access to electricity has empowered them to continue their activities even after sunset. Families who asked to have a of solar-powered LED light in the outside area of their houses will be better able to protect themselves
from creeping venomous animals such as scorpions and snakes.The light makes it so that people can feel safer in the night. Access to a clean source of energy will also allow people to access a better
quality of air. There will be less exposure to respiratory diseases and to spreading fires caused by
candles or lamps, especially for elderly people with vulnerable lungs or families. Classes can still be held effectively at the local primary school, even on low-light days or during winter, when it gets dark earlier than in summer. Children can now work on their homework and study at night at home. The teachers can also work on their grades and prepare classes at night in their homes.
The families are now accessing a free source of energy that
would take them years to purchase by themselves, given that most of the families rely on subsistence
agriculture and do not have the financial means to afford solar panel kits. Now that the families and
teachers can use solar power to replace their kerosene lamps and battery-powered candles, they do not
need to continue buying these temporary light sources. This allows them to save and invest their money
into other basic needs, such as food, education, their families, or improving things in their houses. Luz da
Esperança has also contributed to helping reduce the community's dependency on firewood for lighting,
which is believed will reduce deforestation and avoid potential future conflicts led by vegetation damage
over the next years. Lastly, the young people who took part in the training to help maintain the kits have
also gained a new role in their community, and with it, they have gained an additional way to support
themselves and their community. I feel that this project experience opened my eyes to a big issue that
will still require many more years of work to be solved in my country. After working on this project and
having the chance to learn more about the issues around energy poverty and how it negatively impacts
so many lives, I feel that I finally have the answer to how I can help my people. I found my purpose."

The program’s measurable successes, demonstrated through pre- and post-program assessments,
captured significant gains in students’ confidence, communication, and career exploration skills. Yet the
true measure of impact came in quieter moments: a student asking their mentor about financial aid,
another proudly sharing their career goals for the first time, or a group of mentees excitedly recounting

was born out of my own experiences and observations on how these challenges directly affect young
people, especially since I grew up in that area. To make an impact, I implemented a teaching and
certification program in metrology, with the help and partnership of qualified engineers from Ecuador’s only
internationally accredited metrology laboratory, to offer education and prevent young people from joining
criminal organizations due to a lack of job opportunities. This program provided technical training,
employable skills, and hands-on laboratory experience, while also raising awareness of the importance of
metrology in sustainable development. Metrology for Peace defines peace by demonstrating how accurate measurement can be a pillar of equity
and social justice. By training students to apply precise and unbiased measurements in vulnerable sectors
and certifying talent, this program will help reduce conflicts caused by inaccurate measurements and
promote a culture of trust and peace in society. Our working examples included promoting awareness on
the calibration of medical equipment to reduce medical negligence in the human and veterinary health
fields, which fostering peace through practice and ethics, a key message in the course. Since the proper
calibration of equipment ensures safety protocols and reduces economic losses and deaths, it promotes
peace and safety and longevity for our communities. The production of a network for students in the industry
field aims to provide quality-trained professionals focused on metrology activities, offering a network and
community of practice and support, diverting from gang reliance and activities, contributing to a fairer and
more peaceful city. Of our 30 students, 22 students earn their certificate of participation attending all classes and labs. 12 of
those students earned the required 80% on the course to earn international certification. Some of our
students went from not knowing what metrology was, to having an internationally recognized certificate,
and practiced confidence. All partners in the project were pleased with this success."

Midundo Ya Amani was a reminder of the power of dance as a catalyst for personal, interpersonal, and

affordable staple foods; supports retailers with a stable market and reduced risk of bankruptcy; and
partners reliably with farmers to ensure the consistent purchase of their crops. Located in Kashusha, a
farming village in the eastern region of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), we are in close
proximity to some of the country’s most fertile lands—areas with the potential to feed the entire nation.
Unfortunately, this natural gift has been stifled by decades of conflict, forcing the population to rely on
costly imports and contributing to widespread malnutrition and undernutrition. Throughout this project, we have collaborated with over 20 individuals, compensating them for their
valuable services. This summer, we partnered with two additional workers and hired transportation
services to deliver the machines to our facility. All of the people we've worked with so far are talented
young adults who, due to limited job opportunities, had previously been unemployed. Although many of
them worked with us for only a short period, they were deeply grateful to receive payment for the first time
in a while. They expressed how much they enjoyed working with us and shared their hope that we would
begin hiring soon. Many felt proud that, for the first time in years, there may be a Congolese-owned local
company that benefits other Congolese business owners such as farmers, retailers, and transportation
services. The excitement surrounding the NABINTU project has fueled our confidence in its long-term
success. With this
funding, we successfully completed the corn flour processing line, which had been on hold since last
summer. Acquiring equipment was the most challenging aspect of the initiative, and thanks to Projects for Peace, we overcame that barrier and are now preparing for operational testing. Throughout this journey, I honed my leadership and managerial skills by ensuring we made the most of the resources available and achieved critical milestones.
In addition, PfP support allowed us to pay for local services, providing a meaningful financial boost to
small businesses in a region suffering from a rebel-induced economic drought. The individuals who
supported the transport of our machines, the local manufacturer who produced the milling equipment, and the construction team that installed the doors, windows, and concrete pavement were all direct
beneficiaries of the funding. This marks the beginning of a broader economic revitalization that promises

experience, a professor at the Research Center for Nuclear Weapons Abolition (RECNA) at Nagasaki University gave a lecture on issues surrounding nuclear weapons, and we hosted the afternoon discussion event about “how to be a responsible global citizen in relation to nuclear abolition."" In the second phase, we organized an atomic bomb exhibition at ICU, with photographs about the Nagasaki atomic bombings, testimonies from survivors, and information about nuclear weapons. I define peace as a world where people can connect, cooperate, and strive to make it a better place. If people try to hurt each other, militarize nations, and create separation among people from different nations, that would not be a peaceful world. Nonetheless, a world with nuclear weapons, which are designed to destroy people and the earth, is not needed in the world I define as peace. Our project contributed to peace by delivering the message of “the inhumanity of nuclear weapons
through Nagasaki’s experience,” and that same thing could happen if we do not do anything in the
current situation. To do that, we aimed to connect three dots in all our events: past, present, and future. At the exhibition, we exhibited the devastating experience of Nagasaki, to show “past,” the current world situation with nuclear weapons to show “present,” and created an open area to write about the visitors’ thoughts in the future section. We used a similar technique for the testimony session as well, to combine another discussion session for students to talk about “how to be a responsible global citizen” with the speakers. With many atomic bomb exhibitions often only emphasizing the “past,” our exhibition was unique in the way we asked visitors to go beyond the past, allowing them to think about the current situation with a critical eye. With this purpose, we had 209 people come to our events in total."

contacted organizers in that locality with whom we had existing relationships and created a rough event
plan. Then, we selected experts from our roster of possible panelists and began promoting the
conference, as well as inviting distinguished locals whose attendance or even active participation in the
event might enrich youth attendees’ experience (especially if youth might otherwise have very limited
access to these individuals). In the days preceding a conference, we began transporting and setting up
equipment (e.g. tents, chairs, audiovisual gear, etc.) at the event location. On the day of the conference,
our staff and panelists would meet and get familiar with the event timetable and any other salient details.
Before starting, a moderator, usually from GHH, also reviewed goals and strategies for effectively
engaging young people and communicating complex ideas to them. (In retrospect, this was perhaps one
of the best measures we took, and we probably should have done it even more.) Then we’d begin.  I believe our project helped youth begin to self-orient on
identifying problems, framing and theorizing them in civic and actionable terms (i.e., for our conference
participants themselves to take steps to address the problems they identify), and on where and how to
seek further education on coordinating to overcome collective action problems. Indeed, our conferences
convened and familiarized youth with local civil society leaders, and made them aware of opportunities to
affiliate themselves with formal civil society, which were frequently highlighted as important vehicles for
realizing local and national development because it is through them that international exchange is
possible."

between students in Delhi and Lahore. Over eight weeks, participants engaged in structured online
dialogues, in-person cohort sessions, guest speaker events with experienced peacebuilders, and
designed their own community-based projects to foster empathy and reconciliation across borders. For the purposes of this project, ‘peace’ was defined as the re-definition of relationships heavily
influenced by hostility, historical amnesia, and political and cultural discourse between two countries. We
understood peace not just as the absence of violence but as the presence of relationships,
understanding, and shared responsibility.  
In our view, the project was highly impactful in contributing to this idea of peace: while this was
small-scale, 7 participants from Delhi and Lahore each (14 total) engaged in conversations with each
other. In the short term, we observed participants moving beyond binary ways of thinking. Their
conversations challenged preconceived notions and fostered more nuanced perspectives about the
“Other.”  Participants also designed community-based projects to apply their learning. The
projects included: a heritage documentary on Delhi and Lahore as “tale of two cities,” a fashion initiative
around South Asian peace, an open mic series about India–Pakistan suffering, a history project on the
River Beas, unpacking the relationship between women and the India-Pakistan relationship and creating
a letter exchange amongst school going children in the two countries, amongst others. These were highly
creative, fruitful and gave the participants a chance to understand their role in peacebuilding and the
forms of internal reflection needed.
For many, it was the first time engaging in a cross-border dialogue, which shifted how they
understood cultural and societal assumptions. In the long term, we see participants investing deeply in
their peace projects, with aspirations to scale them up. Several expressed interest in pursuing
peacebuilding as part of their broader life trajectories, signaling that the projects and conversations may
have lasting influence beyond this summer."

Our team defines peace as the absence of conflict, violence, and uncontrollable hardship, alongside the presence of acceptance and comfort with one’s state of being. By supporting empowerment,independence, and well-being, our project may encourage inner peace for individuals facing housing instability. Although we have always considered ourselves optimists, the increase in violence and division in the world can sometimes make society feel as though it is trending toward an “every man for himself” mentality rather than unity. Through this project, we learned that when given the opportunity, people are eager to step forward, collaborate, and make a positive difference. This reinforced our belief in the power of community and the importance of creating spaces for collective action. Furthermore, the project challenged us to adapt quickly and develop practical solutions, strengthening our critical thinking and
problem-solving skills."

Ethiopian youth, including limited access to education, social inequality, and displacement. Recognizing that peace
involves the realization of human rights, we designed a seven-day program guided by the UN Convention on the Rights of
the Child, with each day focusing on a specific right such as education, gender equality, participation, digital literacy, and
environmental sustainability. Students engaged in hands-on activities, mentorship, collaborative research, workshops with
experts, and field visits, applying learning in practical contexts. Our approach emphasized experiential learning, civic
engagement, and solution-oriented thinking, equipping students with advocacy, leadership, critical thinking, and problem-
solving skills while fostering a STEM-driven, innovative mindset.  Peace is built on a profound understanding of challenges and is stabilized through trust and patience.  
Having colleges and collaborators who share a vision and want to jointly follow a purpose is a great leaf of hope even
when it gets complicated. We define our project as peacebuilding, because our goal was to institutionalize the idea of a
Peace Lab with academic legitimation, to build a house for collaboration and expression of the topics of our time. Yet, we
have come to realize that it is the passion behind the process and the engagement of the participants that brings light to
the house and makes it a safe haven in times of crisis. Projects for Peace was an imperative for everyone involved to live
according to a joint definition of peace and to continuously develop it in collaboration to share it. The biggest value that
this project brought is community – the 16 participants grew into a community of changemakers and peers beyond their
scholarly ambition, just as students from German universities and Institute for Peace & Security Studies now connected knowing that there is so much
more peace to build."

missing critical medical appointments because they had no safe place to leave their children. Partnering with hospital administrators, community health promoters, and childcare specialists, we built two free childcare and breastfeeding centers so mothers can prioritize their health while knowing their children are cared for.  Peace comes from having autonomy to care for one’s inner well-being. For mothers, such
peace is hard to achieve when sacrifices on the child’s behalf are expected. The mission of Jali Watoto is
to alleviate mothers of the difficult choice between her child’s safety and her own health. We hope to
promote peace of mind for mothers as they simultaneously prioritize their own health and take care of
their children. Jali Watoto has helped over 6,000 mothers and children and introduced a sense of fun and
play for children at the hospital. While we were there, we saw the benefits of a happy space for mothers
as well. One young mother invited us to jump rope with her and throw a ball around while her baby was
taking a nap. Other parents are simply happy to see their child happy. These short-term benefits extend
into long-term benefits as there are fewer barriers for patients to attend their hospital appointments. For
mothers and children especially, we would expect higher rates of vaccination/treatment and increased
appointment attendance which could lead to improved follow through on treatments that need several
visits.

With the growing aging population worldwide, the question of how to care for our own aging families or families in need has become a universal concern. Peace with Time seeks to create a space for caregivers to practice self-care and share their stories through photography and storytelling. I began sending out cameras and holding online conversations with previous interviewees and new participants. Many participants shared that the film camera became a valuable medium for remembering the loved ones they care for and for creating new memories. This process has evolved into a form of healing and creative therapy, enabling caregivers to become artists documenting the precious time they spend with those they care for."

many issues surrounding the spread of PFAS (Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances) in today’s world,
including their persistence, presence in the environment, health effects, and the current state of
environmental injustice related to the spread of these chemicals.
The film includes expert testimony from three different non-profits, in-the-field journalism, and
archival research and footage.
Alongside the film, a lengthy informative article was developed, aimed at diving deeper into the
specifics of the PFAS crisis, and two public screenings were arranged, both online and in-person,
complete with a panel discussion with leading experts in public health and chemical exposure to foster
community attention and action.I believe peace comes from awareness and access to the truth, giving individuals the power to
make informed decisions about their health, and the ability to speak up for causes that will benefit them
and their community. In this sense, PFAS and You contributes to this by bringing to light many aspects of toxic
chemical contamination that are not well-known to the public, such as the role of chemical manufacturers
and the EPA in allowing this contamination to occur long after the chemicals were determined to be toxic.
This gives the public peace-of-mind through clarity on these complicated topics, and opportunities to
contribute. I found that many of the people I spoke to throughout the making of the film had never heard
of PFAS and were shocked to hear about the implications these chemicals have for health and the
environment."

initiative that centers Sibuyan Island’s globally unique ecology to foster community-led conservation and
youth engagement. Working to address threats from deforestation, biodiversity loss, and the erosion of
local ecological knowledge, the project partnered with local educators at Teresa Bernas Memorial School
to co-develop interactive lessons and activities that make complex environmental concepts accessible to
students, cultivating pride, responsibility, and hope for Sibuyan’s natural heritage. The program combines classroom instruction, experiential outdoor learning, and
thoughtful reflection activities. Each day of the first week, we introduce a core ecological theme, central to
Sibuyan’s unique story–such as island isolation, adaptation, and endemism. These concepts are key to
understanding Sibuyan's importance, while providing necessary context on the broader importance of
biodiversity. In the second week, we move beyond the classroom to hands-on outdoor experiential
learning, connecting students with the ecosystems that surround them. In coordination with local guides
and the DENR, students will explore a Biodiversity Assessment Monitoring System Transect (BAMS)
set-up within the forest of the Bernas-Basa property.

These lessons and activities came alive through participative weekly development meetings with
the head science teacher, Sir Gerald Ruda, where we worked with our team of volunteers to design,
refine, and adapt lesson plans that reflected the uniqueness of the island’s ecology. Throughout the
summer, we worked closely with Sir. Gerald and the school principal to strengthen the project’s
sustainability: supporting his understanding and contributions to the lessons, instilling confidence to
administer them after our departure from Sibuyan, and ensuring that the program fit into the school’s
long-term vision. These locally collaborative efforts in program development are also reflected in our
lesson plan testing. Fifteen local children, all of whom are recent graduates of TBMS, played a critical role
in piloting the lessons and activities. By testing the lessons with them first, we were able to observe which
activities sparked the most engagement, which concepts needed clarification, and how best to pace each
session. Their feedback directly shaped the design of this pilot program, assuring that it is accessible,
enjoyable, and relevant to the lived experiences of similarly aged youth. Additionally, under the guidance
of our project mentors of the Ingle Trust Foundation of Davao and Philippine herpetologist Camilla
Meneses, we strived to strengthen the program’s scientific grounding and pedagogical design. Their
expertise ensured that our curriculum not only communicated key ecological concepts but also reflected
best practices in EE. Our work with place-based environmental education this summer demonstrated to
us that building lasting peace requires a localized-intimate approach and a deep understanding of the
narratives that shape a place. By grounding lessons in Sibuyan’s unique ecology, we saw how students’
pride can grow into a foundation for conservation and community peace.”"

This was achieved through a free, confidential mental health platform in addition to on- ground workshops and other healing activities.
Few organizations operate in AlSweida, and from those, almost none have enough resources or are willing to help survivors due to fear of backlash. Project Ma’man chose a hybrid model to face these challenges: the website and on-ground relief efforts.
Our approach relied on Medup and the Syrian Family Planning Association (SFPA). Medup provided culturally informed therapists and a welcoming space for survivors, while SFPA trained our volunteers and gave our project the credibility and trust it needed. After completing volunteer
training, our city and the community we planned to serve were attacked by terrorists in a multi-day
assault that claimed thousands of lives. During this chaos, our on-ground work stopped, and we
could only provide online support.This experience pushed us to expand our project
to support everyone while keeping a special focus on survivors of sexual assault.
We sought to elevate mental health, something often overlooked. We organized vigils, workshops,
and other events to encourage the use of our platform and to console people during difficult times. Our website is still active and supporting people; we continue to coordinate
workshops and distribution efforts daily, and our volunteers remain committed to providing safe
spaces, reducing stigma, and supporting healing across the region.Our project contributed to peace by giving
survivors and their communities access to support systems that were previously nonexistent. In the
short term, we saw people come together in vigils, workshops, and donation drives to support one
another. In the long term, by normalizing conversations about mental health and sexual assault, we
believe we planted seeds of cultural change that will continue to grow."

Through educational, cultural, and sports resources—including English language course, stocked library, and small gym area— REborn fostered reintegration of marginalized communities and formed local civil culture. True peace is the weaving of communities where veterans, displaced persons, and youth can flourish together, sustained by ongoing commitment to trust and inclusion between groups divided by war.
  This project contributed to peace by addressing the needs of marginalized communities and promoting their integration into a broader civic environment. By focusing on veterans and IDPs, the initiative reduced social polarization and fostered a greater sense of belonging in the remote areas of Chernivtsi Oblast. Beyond equipping youth-veteran centers in Boyany and Chahor, which now serve more than 700 individuals, the project created opportunities for growth through a carefully curated English course, access to libraries, and sports programs.   This project profoundly changed how I think about the world and my place in it. Working with veterans and IDPs—people who lost everything but still embody extraordinary resilience—reminded me of how fragile and precious life is. I lived in two realities: one where people grapple with visible and invisible traumas daily, and another where many remain unaware of this suffering altogether. Bridging these realities has inspired me to continue working in the field of veteran reintegration and advocacy.

often feel excluded from modern learning. In the short term, students gained exposure and excitement for
STEM; in the long term, teacher training has the potential to sustain learning cycles, gradually
transforming educational culture in rural areas. The project emerged from an observation that children in rural Pakistan often lack engaging opportunities
to explore science beyond textbooks. STEM subjects are frequently taught in a rote, exam-focused
manner, which limits creativity, critical thinking, and curiosity. Recognizing this gap, we designed the
Sciventure Carnival as a platform to make STEM accessible and exciting, using interactive exhibits and
models to encourage learning through discovery.
Our main strategy was to create a community-centered science fair, where children could see practical
demonstrations of scientific concepts, experiment with models, and directly engage with ideas that are

and education for all. This principle served as the foundation of our project, since at the core of our
mission, we believe that healthcare is a fundamental human right and that disparities in medical treatment
and diagnoses work to create significant social injustices. To us, true peace exists when historically
marginalized populations have equitable access to healthcare, education, and self-advocacy. We sought
to fulfill and implement our definition of peace through not only educating entire communities and age
groups about skin cancer risk and prevention, but by giving them tangible items that can lift some of the

Through professional guidance, we created a comprehensive suite of resources designed to spark conversation and promote lasting change. We developed five unique triptych pamphlets, each addressing an essential topic for raising awareness about the rights of people with disabilities. The topics were: Communicacion Inclusiva (Inclusive Communication), Conociendo los Apoyos (Understanding Support Systems), IPRODICH: Construyendo Inclusion (IPRODICH: Building Inclusion), Despegando Etiquetas (Removing Labels), and Discapacidades No Evidentes (Non-Apparent Disabilities). Additionally, we designed a ""Commitment to Peace"" credential for each participant to personalize with their name and take with them. On the front of the card, it reads in Spanish: “I commit to building a community of peace, empathy, and respect.” We reached out to a network of local contacts and partners to host 12 ""smaller but more impactful"" inclusive events across five different regions, including isolated or low-resource communities where this information is rarely available. This new model allowed us to be more flexible and to bring the project to the people who needed it most. We distributed 5,000 triptych pamphlets and 600 smaller pamphlets to the community.

Bali, Indonesia, to fix their broken irrigation system. We worked closely with the farmers, the Subak
Tamen, to identify infrastructural issues with their irrigation system, which included a dam and a 3km long
canal, which then feeds their rice fields in the traditional irrigation system called the Subak. This traditional irrigation system is not only culturally and religiously significant and deeply intertwined with
Balinese Hinduism, but it also supports the primary economic system of Munduk Pakel (rice farming).
Preserving this traditional agricultural system counteracts the issues of overtourism and overdevelopment
in Bali. After conducting a preliminary survey, we learned that increasingly frequent periods of drought in
the past few years have made it increasingly difficult for farmers to access water. Additionally, many parts
of the canal and the dam were broken, causing inefficient irrigation. Based on community input, we

students with ethical technology career pathways through mentorship, outreach, and free access to online
learning resources. A major adjustment we made during the project was shifting emphasis from a one-time bootcamp
model to a long-term mentorship and online learning pipeline. Originally, the plan was to run a
summer-long bootcamp, but it became clear that the structural realities of Ghana’s school system made
continuous mentorship more impactful. A significant challenge we encountered was the boarding school restriction on device access. This
structural reality could have prevented students from continuing their learning after the outreach.
However, by intentionally designing the program for instant execution—through brochures, mentorship
forms, and immediate platform sign-ups—we bridged that gap. This experience taught me an invaluable
lesson: effective solutions must be tailored to context. Peacebuilding and development cannot be
imported wholesale; they must respond to the lived realities of the people they serve.
This project transformed my perspective on how technology intersects with peace. It reinforced that
peace is deeply tied to empowerment. By addressing one of the root causes of youth cybercrime—lack of
opportunity—we contribute to a more stable and hopeful society. Tech4Good has inspired me to continue
exploring how technology can be harnessed not only as a career tool but as a powerful mechanism for
social stability and justice. Even in the face of challenges like restricted device access in boarding schools, we
found a way to keep students engaged—because peace is not just about avoiding conflict, but about
creating lasting opportunities for young people to dream, innovate, and thrive.”"

effects of Colombia’s armed conflict by building an open-air theater at INEM public school in Medellín.
The project used art as a vehicle for healing, resilience, and peacebuilding by providing vulnerable
students and families with a space to reflect, perform, and share stories of trauma and recovery.
 Art invites emotional processing, dialogue, and
remembrance, which are essential components of recovery. My aim was to create a permanent space
for these expressions to flourish among young people. the project created both a physical and emotional space for performance, reflection, and
community-building. Students engaged in workshops on writing, acting, and visual storytelling. I
monitored these efforts through weekly meetings with teachers and administrators. In the long term,
the theater will remain a permanent site for artistic and cultural expression, where memory and
imagination work together to process trauma and build resilience.To me, peace is not just about ending violence. Peace is about making sure everyone feels
seen, heard, and valued. It’s about creating spaces where pain can be shared, stories can be told,
and silence can finally give way to a positive voice."

environmental restoration by building a stingless bee apiary, known as a meliponary. With 41 hives of
three species (Jataí, Bugia, and Mandaçaia), the small insects work from dusk until dawn–traveling
upwards of 2 kilometers–to pollinate plants and to produce propolis, resin, and honey.  Spanning only a few millimeters in length, stingless bees bear the responsibility of pollinating the
trees, flowers, and crops that are not only vital for humans, but for the very survival of Brazil’s
deteriorating Atlantic Forest. Through my project of constructing a stingless bee apiary with the help of
committed partners, I was able to channel my passion for biodiversity restoration and protection of these
endangered insects, and I am hopeful that it will inspire local students and community members to take
their own environmental initiatives.This project deepened my understanding of the significance of bees to our planet, taught me how
to navigate unexpected situations with patience and perseverance, and illuminated the importance of
nurturing curiosity about the world in both children and adults. Since I hadn’t engaged in beekeeping prior
to my project, I wasn’t expecting to be so awed by the small creatures’ high level of organization within
their colony’s function and the physical orientation of their hive. Although spanning between only 4-11
millimeters in length (of my three chosen species), they carry the responsibility of so much of our globe’s
function–and they do it with admirable poise and unity amongst themselves. Their inherent nature of
being collaborative is a parallel I recognize in our own society, too, in which we can only thrive collectively
if we each do our part; similarly, when I encountered the dilemma with my construction team, we knew it
could only be cordially resolved by problem-solving together."
2291,The Holistic Wellness Initiative,Lewis & Clark College,Nichole Champion,Oregon,"44.942900,-123.035100",Youth Development,Health & Wellbeing,Educational Enrichment,,,"The Holistic Wellness Initiative created a four-day youth wellness camp at Portland Community College
Cascade Campus that introduced high school students to holistic health practices, nature experiences,
and community-building activities. The project also participated in the fourth year of the Inquiry for Justice
program, continuing to support students through holistic wellness practices in that setting. Together, these
efforts addressed youth mental health challenges by offering creative, accessible opportunities for
students to explore wellness through yoga, art therapy, sound healing, DIY wellness boxes, and field trips.  I define peace as creating spaces of belonging, healing, and empowerment where young people can connect with themselves and one another. Peace, to me, is not the absence of conflict but the presence of opportunity, especially opportunities that allow young people to thrive.
This project contributed to peace in several ways. In the short term, students gained tools for self-care, emotional regulation, and stress relief. They also had the chance to experience joy, connection, and new opportunities, such as berry picking and hiking, activities many had never done before. In the long term, students carry these practices with them into their daily lives, shaping how they respond to challenges, how they support peers, and how they envision healthy futures for themselves and their communities. ""This project reaffirmed my belief that when we invest in young people’s wellness, we are cultivating
peace for the future. I learned that even small spaces of healing and connection can have a
transformative impact, and that the work of creating these spaces is both deeply needed and deeply rewarding."""

I chose to address education and vocational skills because in Bassar, dropout rates, especially among girls, remain high, and opportunities for both practical job training and religious learning are limited. My strategy was to build on an existing community initiative, which already had strong local buy-in but lacked safe, functional facilities. Bassar was the natural site for this project: it is my hometown and a community I have worked with for years. The choice was strengthened by strong local relationships: elders, masons, carpenters, youth volunteers, and families all contributed materials, labor, and oversight. Their support ensured the project was not just mine, but truly ours. A key conflict I faced was balancing the budget between original plans and emerging needs. Some community members wanted technology immediately, while others argued that toilets and water should come first. By listening, convening discussions, and weighing which investment would most directly improve participation, I navigated this tension. I learned that peacebuilding often means choosing priorities that build trust and meet the most pressing human needs.

Initiative: Improving Maternal Health for Women Experiencing Domestic Violence in Pittsburgh,Denison University,Meghan Welch,Pittsburgh,"40.440620,-79.995890",Health & Wellbeing,,Outreach & Information Campaigns,,No,"My project partnered with the Women’s Center and Shelter of Greater Pittsburgh
(WC&S) to develop The M.O.M. Initiative, a maternal health program designed to support women
experiencing domestic violence. By providing essential supplies, hosting workshops, offering education,
and connecting residents with community-based resources, the project aimed to improve maternal
well-being while fostering safety and long-term resilience. I chose to focus on issues that improve maternal health and the lived experiences of residents and their children. After learning that 80–90% of WC&S residents are mothers or caregivers, I recognized the
importance of implementing programming that supports both maternal health and healthy child
development. I focused my workshops on child development and resilience-building following trauma,
along with teaching infant Basic Life Safety (BLS) skills to residents and staff involved in the Child
Advocacy Program daycare. I also collaborated intentionally with community partners new to WC&S to
strengthen the shelter’s network of resources and foster ongoing support for residents after my project
concluded. I define peace as safety, security, and freedom from constant worry, and I believe this project
contributed to peace in meaningful ways. In the short term, mothers gained reassurance that they had the tools, coping skills, and resources to
care for themselves and their children safely, while staff experienced peace of mind knowing they had a
reliable supply of essential items and new knowledge to better support residents. In the long term, the
relationships established with community partners and the resources provided to staff are likely to
continue influencing programming at WC&S, ultimately benefiting future residents."

their growth or opportunities. In Alexandra, period poverty was one of those barriers. By removing it even
temporarily, we gave girls more freedom to show up in school and in their lives without shame. This project managed to give girls tools to stay in school, boosting their confidence, and reducing stigma
through open dialogue.
In the short term, the project provided immediate relief and knowledge. In the long term, it planted seeds
of self-reliance and community-driven change, as girls are now able to share these skills with others.The decision to focus on period poverty came from my lived experience growing up in South Africa and
witnessing how a lack of menstrual products kept girls out of school. I knew this was not simply a “health”
issue but also about education, confidence, and equity. For that reason, I designed the project to provide
both products and education, so that participants could meet their immediate needs while learning
sustainable ways to care for themselves.
Over the summer, I conducted seven workshops across seven weeks, reaching approximately 60 girls
per session. These workshops were supported by teachers, nurses, an occupational therapist, and
university volunteers. Each session combined menstrual health education with practical pad-making
training, as well as discussions on breaking stigma, managing hygiene, and building self-confidence.
Many girls expressed that it was the first time they had openly spoken about menstruation in a supportive
space."

in 2021, that empowered 20 children in Kwali, Nigeria to build foundational skills in reading, writing, math,
and programming. The camp ignited the children’s interest in learning, fostered self-worth and critical
thinking, and engaged parents and the community to reshape attitudes toward education as a
transformative investment.The Peace Camp contributes to peace by tackling an
issue that hinders peace in Nigeria: unequal access to education. Our strategy for preventing and
eliminating illiteracy centers on extending educational opportunities to those whose lack of access places
them at a disadvantage, thereby addressing not only immediate needs but also the structural factors that
perpetuate educational inequality.At the camp, participating children were introduced to education through lessons in English
language, mathematics, and computer programming. We also deliberately integrated opportunities to
debunk misleading connotations parents and children had about education. The camp was launched with
a parents engagement session where parents were given the safe space to express their concerns about
education and the camp in general. For the children, we had both spontaneous and structured sessions,
where we designed activities to boost confidence in their intellectual abilities.
Throughout the program, we stayed connected with parents through a WhatsApp group  and by reaching out via calls or in-person visits for parents who couldn’t join the Whatsapp group.
Perhaps the most remarkable achievement of The Peace Camp was its impact on people— on children
who gained access to education, on parents whose outlook on formal education shifted, and on us, the
team, who carry forward the peace-building skills we learned."

bedding sets, notebooks, electrical supplies and such that has transformed their living conditions. I was determined to conduct more community bonding activities so I considered the strict daily schedule
of monks to implement the project which meant it had to occur during weekends and caused the project
to take longer than expected. It was worth the effort as I learnt a lot more about the individual lives of
monks and the privileges that most people have that go unnoticed and underappreciated. I also learnt
that in the monastic community they follow ‘Kuenzangcholing’ that means to be the one and it saved the
project significant labor costs as when painters were needed we became painters, when electricians were
needed we became electricians and when chefs were needed we became the chefs. Through these
conversations I also learnt that the monastery only gets monthly supplies for 20 monks who are officially
registered, although they have 60 monks because of underlying issues in the society where
disadvantaged families enroll their children in monasteries. Peace for me is to live without having to worry about basic necessities such as food, water and shelter
allowing me to help myself and others. I am truly at peace when I am able to appreciate small things in

Our project addressed the urgent issue of child marriage prevention in the United States. Each year, nearly 300,000 minors under age 18 are married in the U.S. (Journal of Adolescent Health, 2021). In response, we established a 501(c)(3) nonprofit to ensure accountability and sustainability. We built an emergency response app with a live chat function, conducted a needs-based assessment through cross-disciplinary collaboration, created a modular curriculum with two distinct trainings (one for schools and one for shelters), developed a website with donation functionality, designed a professional social media campaign that is launching this month, and prepared a slide deck for dialogues that was collaboratively created by our team and reviewed by a professional facilitator. Because the curriculum is already modular, we are actively preparing to distribute it to a broader set of institutions, including hospitals and faith communities. We are also expanding NBAs nationally and leveraging the social media campaign to broaden awareness and partnership-building. Importantly, we are now positioned to host community dialogues using the collaboratively created and professionally reviewed slide deck. These dialogues will deepen partnerships, encourage community ownership, and expand prevention strategies. The grant laid the groundwork for both immediate protection and long-term systemic change.

engineering, public health, prosthetics, agriculture, and cultural affairs—each designed to respond to urgent
needs while building long-term resilience. Through collaborative efforts between UF students, local
Ukrainian partners, and international supporters, we adapted plans midstream to ensure material aid,
cultural exchange, and symbolic solidarity could meaningfully support a city under war’s shadow. We define peace as the process of meeting urgent human needs while fostering dignity, connection, and
hope across communities. Our project contributed to peace both materially—through medical equipment,
infrastructure progress, and cultural training—and symbolically, by demonstrating to Nizhyn that students
thousands of miles away are committed to their recovery. Short-term, the ECGs and prosthetic work will
ease suffering for individuals, while oral histories and student exchanges have already deepened
understanding across borders. Long-term, infrastructure upgrades and preserved narratives will sustain
resilience, offering a model of partnership-driven rebuilding.
A moment that embodied this came during our virtual meeting with the Nizhyn City Council. Even as we
presented tangible updates, what resonated most was their gratitude for symbolic solidarity, especially as
we congratulated them on Ukraine’s Independence Day. In that exchange, it became clear that peace is
not only the absence of conflict but also the presence of unwavering human connection. The conflict we
navigated most often was internal: balancing shifting needs and limited budgets across divisions. By
listening, compromising, and reallocating, we ensured each project could still move forward. This
experience deepened our collective understanding of adaptive peacebuilding—responding with flexibility

community I loved degraded. Many trees were cut down, and holes were dug everywhere. The
government had deployed police throughout the area to control the situation, and I heard the teachers’
concerns about the number of students dropping out due to illegal mining. This received national attention
and was all over the newspapers.
I chose to equip people with sewing skills to resolve the issue because the people who engaged in illegal
mining activities were mostly high school dropouts, and they lacked academic qualifications to be hired
for most jobs. Sewing is a skill that can be learned quickly, and individuals can be hired by textile
companies in Zimbabwe, employed by tailors in Gwanda, or start their own practice. Sewing is a
therapeutic skill, giving us the space to sit together and explore ways to strengthen our community. It also
signifies mending a community that is falling apart and sewing the traumatic parts of these people’s lives,
giving them a better chance at a brighter future. I define peace as the absence of conflict, living in harmony with oneself, other people and
the environment.
Sewing peace reduces the prevalence of illegal mining activities, which reduces crime and harm done to
the environment. In the short term, the project provided our participants with a sustainable and legal
alternative to earn a living. In the long term, I hope that this project encourages environmentally
sustainable practices in the region and in the country. I also hope that similar approaches on training

Teel-Taaba in Zoundweogo Province, this project empowered over 50 refugees through sustainable
agricultural training, critical resources, and market connections. This report details the project’s
implementation, reflects on its contributions to peace, and summarizes the personal growth it fostered.
Project Description, Implementation and Adaptation
The project’s approach was rooted in the belief that lasting peace is built on economic security
and agency. Zoundweogo Province was selected due to its high concentration of displaced families,
and Teel-Taaba’s established presence made them the ideal partner. Together, we identified
participants through community consultations, prioritizing families most affected by displacement and
those with interest in farming. A joint management committee composed of refugees, host community
members, and Teel-Taaba staff was established to ensure accountability and local ownership.“By equipping refugee families with the means to cultivate their own food and generate income, we did
more than plant crops; we planted hope and a renewed sense of dignity. This project reminded me that
peace begins with opportunity, and that empowering communities to lead is one of the strongest paths
to lasting stability.” I define peace not as merely the absence of violence, but as the presence of conditions for a
dignified life: stability, opportunity, and the ability to shape one’s future. Un Nouveau Départ contributed
to this vision by addressing fundamental needs. In the long term, the structures created (training, tools,
irrigation, and market access) are designed to generate income, strengthen resilience, and foster social
cohesion between refugees and host communities."

UNBOUNDED bridged that gap by partnering with Girls in Tech Zimbabwe and Empowered Youth Generation to empower 35 changemakers with research methods, coding, and social entrepreneurship at Matinunura High School in Mkoba. Personally, this project has reshaped my perspective on leadership. I began with preconceived notions of
how it “should” go, but quickly realized we had to meet the girls where they were, not where we wanted
them to be. This demanded patience, empathy, and a willingness to adapt using human-centered design.
Watching these girls transform from shy, hesitant students into confident, curious leaders has been the
most rewarding part. Although I managed the project remotely, I gained deep insight into trust, delegation,
and resilience. Leading from afar required me to believe in others, and Mitchel’s dedication turned my
vision into reality. I am profoundly grateful for the support of my team in Zimbabwe, whose hard work has
made this dream a success.
Peace, to me, is not abstract. It is the moment when a young girl begins to believe in her own potential
and carries others along with her. Peace is exposing students who were once marginalized to
opportunities they never imagined possible. Through UNBOUNDED, I see changemakers being born,
leaders daring to do the impossible, and I am confident we are heading in the right direction."

they receive. Through content, closed events, and meetings, we wanted to help people reflect on
neglect and violence, and to support self-understanding and mutual care. The foundation of peace is
individual development, and since personality, habits, and psychological patterns are formed in
childhood, the project was made to show how neglect and violence can influence a person’s entire
life. To include multiple perspectives across age and social background, we used a three-part,
complementary approach—personal testimony, direct conversations with at-risk youth, and
community-level dialogue and support. Because it was difficult to find people willing to share openly, and because children’s rights had to be
respected, only one story was made public on TV. The others were adapted into closed events rather
than videos. For me, peace means being able to manage one’s own emotions and relationships without being a
burden to oneself or others. When people understand themselves, they can understand others and
resolve problems. Financial stability is also part of this balance.
Our project, I think, contributed to this idea of peace. It was able to create a space for courage and
openness. When the participant shared her story honestly and bravely, it inspired many viewers to
reflect on their own lives and find strength within themselves. Those who attended the events said
that the conversations gave them better understanding of their own situations."

in Bangladesh, because of the scale of health needs there. With over 1.5 million refugees crowded into
just 13 square kilometers, the camps face critical shortages of resources, space, and access to care,
making them one of the most densely populated and underserved places on Earth.
I shaped my project around three goals: (1) to strengthen knowledge through medical and mental health education workshops; (2) to provide children with hygiene tools and disease prevention education through personalized care packages, and (3) to launch the camp’s first Comfort Clinic, a trauma-informed space for youth healing and belonging.  I have come to define peace as human dignity restored: when people feel safe to thrive as
themselves, without the weight of neglect or exclusion. That vision shaped the heart of my project. In the
short term, the work provided practical skills and spaces of joy for children and youth, with a deeper
purpose to cultivate resilience, community capacity, and healing in the face of displacement. Watching
children step into the Comfort Clinic and recognize it as a space they could claim and shape for
themselves showed me what peace can look like even in one of the world’s most precarious settings. At
the same time, I confronted challenges that revealed how fragile dignity can be. One of the most
significant was navigating the language and cultural barriers among Bangla-speaking aid workers and
Rohingya-only speakers. Though I am fluent in Bangla, it became clear that refugees’ isolation is
deliberately reinforced by policies that prevent integration into the host society. To overcome this, I leaned
on nonverbal teaching, translation from local staff, and patience in listening. All of these moments
reminded me that the restoration of dignity requires more than the provision of resources; it includes
bridging divides in communication and trust. These experiences left me eager to learn more about
intercultural communication and trauma-informed teaching, so that I can better serve communities on the
margins of society whose voices are often left unheard."

that age. They got to build and create using skills they had learned, and feel a sense of accomplishment.
It was a joy to see my students' faces light up when their keyboard or sensor projects worked and they
could play notes with what they had made. Long-term, I witnessed many students going from having an “I

transcriptions inform how I represented Chinatown– what I drew for each panel and splash page (a full
page of illustration) reflected the sentiments of the interviewee.I will end the series by connecting the
ongoing crises previously mentioned to Chinese Exclusion. Chinese Exclusion marks the first time in U.S.
history where a group of people were banned and forcibly removed from the U.S. based on race. Though
the opinions of my interviewees varied, they had all mentioned past or present issues around the
immigration status of some of Chinatown’s residents. This project has become a means for me to be a
better advocate and I’m excited to be able to show support for a community I love through my art."
2342,Wings of Women,Washington & Lee University,Anshika Patel,Uttar Pradesh,"26.839280,80.923130",Health & Wellbeing,,Equipment & Materials,,No,"Wings of Women (WoW) addressed menstrual health inequity and economic disempowerment among
rural women in Pawara, Uttar Pradesh, by establishing a community-driven manufacturing unit for
affordable, reusable cloth pads. Working with local partner TOY (Teaching Outstanding Youth) and
community volunteers, the project trained 50 women in pad production and business skills, hired 10 as
manufacturers, and created a sustainable model that provides both menstrual hygiene solutions and
economic opportunities for underprivileged women. Peace has a different definition for women in my neighboring community, Pawara, in the northern Indian
state of Uttar Pradesh. For them, peace is more than the absence of conflict—it's having the women's
right and courage to talk openly about menstruation, access to gynecologists and menstrual pads,
financial independence, and protection against domestic violence.
Contribution to Peace
Short-term changes include immediate access to hygienic menstrual products for hundreds of women,
reduction in fungal infections, and economic empowerment for 10 manufacturer-employees. 
A significant challenge arose when some community elders initially resisted women discussing
menstruation openly, viewing it as culturally inappropriate. We navigated this by engaging male
community leaders, emphasizing health benefits for their families, and involving respected women as
ambassadors. This taught me the importance of working within cultural frameworks rather than against
them, using respected voices to facilitate change. I'd like to learn more about gender-sensitive community
engagement strategies and how to scale culture-change initiatives effectively. When we address basic human needs like menstrual health while simultaneously
creating economic pathways, we don't just solve problems; we transform lives and communities. The
most powerful lesson was seeing how women, given the right tools and support, become the architects of
their own liberation and the catalysts for broader social change."""
2248,Winjo Integrated Livelihoods and Empowerment Project,Davidson College,Victoria Ochieng,"Migori, Kenya","-1.063430,34.473130",Environment & Climate,Economic Development & Entrepreneurship,Equipment & Materials,,No,"This summer, I had the privilege of leading the Winjo Integrated Livelihoods and Empowerment
Project (WILEP) in partnership with ChildSpace Organization and Tupande Africa. WILEP was a
community-driven initiative that sought to empower the people of Winjo to sustainably adapt to climate
change while fostering economic resilience and mobility. Through WILEP, we trained 50 farmers on
climate smart agriculture, gave them drought-resistant seeds and fertilizers, and enrolled them in Tupande
Africa, a program that supports farmers across Africa to improve their yields and resilience. Through WILEP, I have come to understand that peace is not only the absence of conflict but also the presence of collective responsibility, fairness, and mutual support. Through the goat program and support for chamas, the Winjo community embodied the principles of Ubuntu and Harambee. I saw this spirit come alive when the village elders volunteered to walk with me from one edge of the village to the other to ensure that no household was left out. Now that I think of it, identifying the 40 most vulnerable households would have been a real challenge without community input, and I cannot fully express how important that was. I also appreciate the support of the deputy headteacher and the students of Winjo Secondary School; through their support, we were able to support three students by clearing part of their school arrears. These collective approaches reduced inequalities, minimized potential conflicts, and helped build trust. Similarly, the climate-smart agriculture training and access to Tupande Africa’s resources has equipped farmers with tools to improve their livelihoods while managing natural resources sustainably. And when households can secure food and income without competing destructively for scarce resources, tensions decrease, and a culture of cooperation grows. Another key lesson I learned through this is the importance of community ownership."
2246,WiseBox: Empowering Internally Displaced Youth Through Innovative Clean Energy Tech,Dartmouth College,Triumph Kia Teh,Cameroon,"6.000000,12.000000",Youth development,Economic Development & Entrepreneurship,Skills Development,Technology Innovation & Tools,Yes,"The WiseBox project addressed energy poverty and educational inequality for internally displaced students in Cameroon, alongside the environmental crisis of plastic and electronic waste. We used an approach centered on education and hands-on skills training, working with 60 students in Obili, Yaoundé, and 40 in Bamenda to build portable, solar-powered boxes from upcycled materials. We identified a direct correlation between the lack of reliable electricity in IDP communities and falling educational outcomes. Students could not study after dark. Simultaneously, we observed severe plastic and electronic waste pollution. We chose a solution that tackled both issues: empowering students to convert waste into a functional educational tool (light and power) through a project-based learning model. This approach provided immediate aid while building long-term, sustainable skills. Our local partnership with the Open Dreams Center in Yaounde was indispensable. They provided a venue for strategic planning and workshops, helped with community engagement and trust- building, integrated our curriculum into their Summer Academy schedule, and provided logistical support. This partnership was the cornerstone of our project's successful implementation. Our partner, Mboa Hub, provided us with facilitators and study materials used during the training. Our original plan focused primarily on distribution. Based on community input during planning, we pivoted to a more impactful ""teach-to-fish"" model. We expanded the project scope to include a comprehensive 6-week technical curriculum and the development of a proprietary Learning Management System (LMS) www.dewise-energy.com. This adjustment ensured the knowledge remained within the community, allowing students to maintain, repair, and replicate the WiseBoxes themselves, vastly increasing the project's long-term impact and sustainability. We also built a community solar energy system at Mboa Hub, where these internally displaced families can charge their boxes for eventual use. This project has challenged my understanding of innovation. I learned that the most powerful
solutions are not always the most technologically complex, but those that are context-specific,
resourceful, and community-owned. It has inspired me to view constraints not as barriers, but as
the very materials for creating change."
2337,Women Weave Change,University of Richmond,Minahil Mobeen,Punjab,"31.558000,74.350710",Economic Development & Entrepreneurship,,Skills Development,Equipment & Materials,No,"The central issue this project tackled was the lack of financial independence and poor working
conditions for women working in the carpet weaving industry. Due to the traditional home-based
structure of carpet weaving, outdated equipment, and lack of access to knowledge, female carpet
weavers face economic instability, health risks, and limited decision-making power, while communities
suffer from slower social and economic growth. Therefore, the solutions were designed to be realistic,
compliant with community norms, and relevant to their most pressing needs. By creating a
centralized workspace equipped with a daycare center for the artisans, alongside hosting workshops, the
project fostered a sense of independence for the women. For me, peace is the creation of equitable opportunities that reduce exploitation, enable self-sufficiency,
and foster community solidarity. It involves the establishment of structures that allow people to live with
economic security, dignity, and hope. Within this project, peace refers not only to the absence of barriers
to social development but also the presence of resources and knowledge that increase resilience and
independence.
‘Women Weave Change’ fulfilled these aspects of developing peace as the centralized and supportive
nature of the weaving center alongside skills-focused workshops allowed them to build knowledge in
strategies to reduce exploitation and improve autonomy. It further strengthened the community’s
commitment to equitable opportunities by involving men in the establishment of the center and
creating a daycare center for children. In the short term, the women expressed that they felt more
productive and focused while working at the center and demonstrated greater confidence in their
ability to manage finances due to the workshops. Moreover, we observed increased morale and
security due to the provision of reliable income and better workspaces.
For the long term, we expect to see increased production and a steady source of income for the
community through consistent employment as fair labor conditions and wages will be monitored closely
by DCHD and Label STEP. Moreover, we further anticipate better attendance at school and greater say
of women in financial matters. Through preserving cultural heritage and creating equitable
opportunities, the project will strengthen community cohesion and ensure long-term stability, while
financial literacy workshops will foster intergenerational education and peacebuilding."

challenges of instability and limited opportunities for young people with leadership and entrepreneurial
skills, fostering mental health awareness and encouraging community engagement. Bringing together
20 young people from all eight regions, the project fostered inclusion and resilience, empowering
participants to become agents of peace who drive change within their communities. We chose to believe in the potential of our youth, to help them see
themselves as capable and important and to show them that they can contribute to something bigger
than themselves. YEP really has an objective to give the young people the opportunities they lack. We
saw peace not as an abstract goal but as a process that begins when young people are empowered
to take responsibility for their communities and feel that their voice, skill and actions truly matter.
To bring this vision to life, we designed a month-long program around four pillars which are
leadership, entrepreneurship, mental health and community engagement. Each week focused on a
single pillar, combining interactive workshops, hands-on exercises and reflection sessions.
Participants were guided by guest speakers, trainers and local professionals, who shared their
expertise and inspired our participants to see the value of their contributions.  “Peace isn’t something we wait for, it’s something we create.Through YEP, I learned that lasting
change begins with young people who dare to believe in themselves, take action and lift others along
the way. Leadership isn’t about waiting for permission—it’s about making tough choices, trusting
yourself and seeing opportunity in every obstacle. Today more than ever, I am convinced that we are
not just the leaders of tomorrow, we are the leaders of today”"
2257,Youth Governance Lab,Gettysburg College,Nafis Imtiaz Imam,Dhaka,"23.710400,90.407440",Governance & Civic Engagement,Youth development,Educational Enrichment,,Yes,"The idea for the Youth Governance Lab emerged from recognizing that although youth constitute the largest
demographic in Bangladesh, they are often underrepresented and disengaged from governance processes
due to limited access to civic education and democratic literacy. To bridge this gap, we designed interactive
and experiential workshops to raise awareness of governance issues, promote accountability, and equip
young individuals with the knowledge and skills required for active civic participation. Our strategy leveraged participatory learning methods, including simulations, group discussions, role- playing, and practical campaign design, to translate abstract governance concepts into relatable experiences for participants. Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh, was strategically chosen as the central
workshop site due to its accessibility and capacity to convene youth from across the country. Through
strong local networks and partnerships, we successfully recruited 60 participants from 28 districts, more
than 75% of whom traveled from outside the capital. The group was diverse: 77% students, 17% working
professionals, and 3% entrepreneurs.Peace, to me, is an inclusive, just, and accountable society, one where each individual feels safe, valued,
and empowered to engage without fear, oppression, or exclusion. The Youth Governance Lab directly
contributes to building peace by enabling youth to challenge injustice constructively, promoting civic
participation rather than conflict. In the short term, the workshops fostered dialogue, understanding, and
immediate awareness among participants. In the long term, they laid a sustainable foundation for youth-led
movements advocating transparency, human rights, and social accountability throughout Bangladesh. A
notable challenge we encountered involved navigating the divergent political beliefs among participants,
which occasionally led to tensions in discussions. We addressed this proactively by emphasizing respectful
and inclusive dialogue, establishing clear ground rules for communication, and utilizing structured
simulations to shift discussions from divisive ideologies toward collective civic responsibility. This

experience reinforced my appreciation for facilitation and conflict-sensitive engagement skills in youth-
focused programming, an area I am now even more inspired to explore and refine. This project profoundly

reshaped my understanding of peace, reaffirming that enduring harmony cannot rely solely on policies or
treaties; rather, it is rooted deeply in grassroots education, empathy, and meaningful empowerment.
Witnessing the transformative growth of young people through this initiative has inspired me to deepen my
commitment to civic education and youth leadership, guided by the conviction that informed, engaged, and
empowered youth are indeed the strongest architects of a peaceful and just future."
2263,Youth Leaders Exchange Program,Georgetown University,Elene Chkhaidze,Georgia,"33.749000,-84.387980",Social Cohesion,Youth development,Educational Enrichment,,,"The Youth Leaders Exchange Program (YLEP) was a five-day peacebuilding camp held in Solo Grand
Boshuri, Georgia (July 25–30). It brought together 15 ethnic Armenian, Azerbaijani, and Georgian youth
living in Georgia to participate in dialogue, trust-building, and nonviolent communication workshops.
Through interactive methods such as team-building activities, cooperative problem-solving exercises, and
role-plays on conflict resolution, the camp created a space for participants to build trust, develop practical
communication skills, and lay the foundations for cross-community cooperation in the South Caucasus. YLEP was created to confront this estrangement by bringing youth together across community lines. The
camp focused on directly engaging with differences through dialogue, trust-building, and nonviolent
communication. Our partner, The 16th Element, a peacebuilding organization active across Georgia, provided professional facilitators who led workshops on conflict resolution and dialogue. Storytelling, role-plays, and outdoor team-building exercises encouraged participants to reflect on personal experiences while developing cooperation and trust.  What stood out to me during YLEP was that the real challenge among Armenian, Azerbaijani, and
Georgian youth in Georgia wasn’t open conflict, but quiet distance. This estrangement came from
everyday realities: growing up in different regions, speaking different languages, and going to separate
schools. Many Armenian and Azerbaijani participants said it was their first time meeting peers from the
other minority community, even though they live in the same country. For some, not feeling confident in
Georgian made it harder to fully join in, which only reinforced that sense of being on the margins. Yet it
was powerful to see that, despite these barriers, everyone found ways to open up and contribute.
In just a few days, I watched how quickly that distance faded once people had the chance to connect. In
storytelling circles and group reflections, participants returned again and again to the same themes:
navigating the challenges of holding multiple identities as Georgian Armenians and Azerbaijani
Armenians, coping with societal pressures, and imagining their futures. Hearing these similarities
humanized “the other side” — participants began to see that many of their experiences overlapped, and
that the lines dividing them were not as unbridgeable as they once seemed. It reminded me that
peacebuilding in the South Caucasus is not only about political negotiations, but also about creating
everyday opportunities for young people to meet across divides and feel part of a shared community"
